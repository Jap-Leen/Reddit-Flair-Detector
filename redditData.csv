Many people want him gone, but the only place our government can send him right now is back to India. I have heard people say sending him back to India would be a death sentence due to the religious tension he has caused, and I'm wondering whether that's true.",26," Are there a lot of people (in government and public) in Malaysia who want him gone?. Not a death sentence, but looking at his direct involvement in radicalization of youth he should be looking at a life sentence.
But also considering the current situation of judiciary, his case might take many years before actually reaching to a conclusion. He might live a normal life outside jail while having a couple or may be dozen of court hearings a year. I would deport him to Syria [deleted] Terror attack in Bangladesh (neighbouring country) on communal grounds

Zakir Naik “inspired” the terror attack

Fled the country.

Whatever happens to him depends on the Judiciary. Indian Judiciary is strong and independent of the government.

The Pakistani 2008 26/11 terrorist was also given legal representation and a fair civil trial in open court. Despite the public outcry, the Judiciary ensured a fair trial.

If Zakir Naik has broken any law in India, he would be punished by the Judiciary under said law. He will be arrested .. he will be put through Indian justice system ,.. it will take years before there will be any verdict... very likely he will get life sentence ...  

But he also has supporters in politics circles (votes matter) ... if party who rules central government changes   ... there is a possibility he might get away with some light punishment 

It’s fake propaganda that he will be killed... chances of that happening is very slim ... we have people who wants to break this country roaming* free... He is banned by many other countries too. That should tell you something. 
Get that mofo out of your country asap. he will not get death sentence because he didn't raped a minor and killed them after or directly caused a terrorist attack that cost life. max he will get is 20 years and most probably get out in 10. In a way its good for india you guys have him because it will cause massive riots in india if he will go to jail. We don't want him back, keep him as long as you like or if you don't want to then send him to your neighbouring Singapore. No way will he be killed in India. He'll definitely not be sentenced to death because that's for the rarest of the rare and the type of crimes he's been charged with like Money laundering and maybe some charges of inciting terror wouldn't get him that punishment. Still, I'd much rather you guys keep him because him coming here will only incite more hatred between Indian religious groups here as his case goes on so I'd rather he stays away. If he is sent to India chances of him being dead is very less. He will be tried in court and the max that is gonna happen is life in prison, Im even doubtful that he would get life in prison. His crime is not eligible for death sentence. Hopefully he gets imprisoned in some other country cus Indian Judicial system is way too slow",32,0.82,1565989564.0
2,cp8xyy,Increasingly polarized political opinions in indians. Is minority appeasement politics to blame here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cp8xyy/increasingly_polarized_political_opinions_in/,Political,"[Please remember this is my personal opinion. I am open for counter arguments and honestly hoping that I am wrong as I would like for things to be better]

Hi,
I've been wondering about this for some time. The Indian voter had become increasingly politically polarized in recent times. Many would attribute this to the rising right wing in the country. But I believe the rise of right wing in recent time is linked to rising resentment in the majority Hindu population with the invearse in minority appeasement politics in the other mainstream parties.

Democracy works best when parties campaign on generic issues on the forefront. This leads to voters voting for the party with the best manifesto. Voters are not loyal to one party and will vote for they opposition if the current ruling party messes up.

But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group? Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them. Keep doing this and you generate a messaiah subject relation with the voters, and the respective community becomes faithful to your party. This might be enough to sway the total votes to your favour, given the majority is still divided.

With time, the public is increasingly divided and hostile to other parties as it is now either their party (with the specific benefits promised) or the others, which do nothing for you. 

This has carved up the voter base in India into distinct sections voting only for freebies or specific policies which only affect them, even at the expense of others.

Do you guys think this is an issue in current times? 

If yes how does politics go back to the way it was before? Why would a party running on appeasing a specific community give it up when this doesn't give them any benefits?

I believe the rise of the BJP can be related to this too. With regards to my relatives living in UP, they will now not vote for SP or BSP in any situation as this will only lead to development of ""other"" people and believe BJP is the only way to get their voice heard. Given that my relatives are conservative hindus, and with them being the majority, how will other parties ever win, given that they have lost the majority votes to a party doing minority appeasement, only this time, it is for the majority.",34," What minority appeasement you talking about? There was no minority appeasement (as Sachar committee report clearly showed) , and development is not a zero-sum game between groups. That minority appeasement leads to or has lead to majority impoverishment/extinction is a propaganda invention of hindutva not proved by any economic or census data. Since it was empty propaganda to start with, there is nothing to go back to. This is an opinion post. Kind of like a change my mind. I am not proposing new agendas, just looking for suggestions to fixing some of the issues related to increasing polarized political opinions Yes I think one of the major reason for the rise of BJP is hate for Congress and its Dynasty type ruling. Modi was elected as there was no one else to lead. 
The day we have anyone as good as modi, people will forget Modi and move on to the next one. Real-life in Karnataka:   When I was doing my BE. Normal peoples tuition fees with merit were 50k INR per year.

Sc/STs were around 25k INR.

(Christians its more than Sc/St I think not sure about this.)

Muslims its 0 INR.

This is not based on the economy of the family. Just religion.


We all wrote Entrance exam in Karnataka above fees is only who got seats in the merit-based system. But merit rank is not the same for everyone. even there Muslims/Sc/ST had reservations.

I don't what else you can call it other than minority appeasement.



Most of the temple comes under devasom board in Kerala. Temples cant use its own money from devotees as they want. it all goes to Govt. then govt. decides salaries of priest etc...

SO net flow of money from Hindu institutions is always negative(Temples I Know its more than 25% loss)

No such things for mosques or churches.


These things really hurt the sentiments of everyday local people. 

If you want secular country Govt, Should treat all religious institutions same, no extra provisions. Just like the US.

I personally think it is not bad if Govt is leaning towards Hindu(Since it is native to India, not an invasive ideology) institutions in India, cause most of ""Secular"" Europe leans towards Christianity. Not to mentions middle east. This is a global phenomenon now. It’s a backlash against way too much overt political correctness. > But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group?

> Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem No, it's mainly the incredibly efficient RSS/BJP propaganda machine that is responsible for the situation we see today. But that certainly was not possible by-itself, the opposition failed miserably and offered no resistance. The thing is, Right-wing populism is the easiest thing to sell. It appeals to passion and emotion which are major factors in building up support.",14,0.68,1565622881.0

However, if someone else tries to check the situation , the situation would get dangerous !

So, stay at home & listen to what the governor says.

:( It is so appalling how the Indian media has covered it. Most of the media (with the notable exceptions like The Wire, The Quint, Telegraph and The Hindu) has been acting like a state propaganda machine. I had never imagined that I would see anything like this happen in my country and to this extent. We really are living in a post-truth world. Great to have Kashmir news thread back again. Thanks to  [u/gujjuben](https://www.reddit.com/user/gujjuben/) for this. Things are far from normal. It will take some time and news about Kashmir is hard to get. There is no war in Ba Sing Se. If you think things in Indian Kashmir are bad, have a look at some of the things that have been going around in Pakistani Kashmir. 

One part of Kashmir (Gilgit-Baltistan) literally wants to break away from Kashmir and join Pakistan as a province. Infact, the people have never liked being a part of Kashmir because the entire region was unified with Kashmir when the British came by.

Some articles on life in Pakistani Kashmir:

* [Tight controls on freedom of expression have been a hallmark of government policy in Azad Kashmir. Pakistan has prevented the creation of independent media in the territory through bureaucratic restrictions and coercion. Under Azad Kashmir's constitution, which Pakistan enforced in 1974, election candidates are “prescreened” to ensure that only those who support Kashmir's union with Pakistan can contest elections. Anyone who wants to take part in public life in Azad Kashmir has to sign a pledge of loyalty to Pakistan, while anyone who publicly supports or peacefully works for an independent Kashmir faces persecution.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/21/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free)

* [After accession in 1948, the government declared Gilgit-Baltistan an agency of the central government, and deployed a political agent to administer its affairs through the Frontier Crimes Regulation — the notorious set of laws that allows collective punishments, outlaws political activity, and denies basic rights like appeal, wakeel and daleel (the right to appeal detention, the right to legal representation and the right to present reasoned evidence) in the tribal areas.](https://www.dawn.com/news/794958/from-the-fringes-gilgit-baltistanis-silently-observe-elections)

* [Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Abdul Majeed once warned Pakistan against any attempt to convert Gilgit-Baltistan into a province of Pakistan](https://www.dawn.com/news/1193315)

* [Lacking proper legal rights and a democratic set-up, the territory (Gilgit-Baltistan) has faced a number of human rights violations over the years. Currently, over a hundred activists have been charged with sedition for demanding greater self-rule in the disputed territory. Students, social workers and political activists have also been languishing in jails.](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/08/article/gilgit-baltistan-faces-human-rights-violations/)

* [On 6 February 2018, human rights activists raised the issue of human rights violations in Gilgit-Baltistan, Balochistan and against Mohajirs in Karachi in a meeting of the US Foreign Relations Committee, in Washington DC.](https://unpo.org/article/20616)

* [Gilgit-Baltistan's inhabitants are embittered by Pakistan's unwillingness to devolve powers in real terms to its elected representatives. The rise of sectarian extremism is an alarming consequence of this denial of basic political rights.](http://www.dawn.com/news/480097) Can we have a NRC megathread on the sub too by the way? Or a combined Kashmir and NRC one?

The NRC is another human rights disaster waiting to happen. Thankfully, the final draft of the NRC released a couple of days ago didn't meet the expectations of the BJP so they themselves are protesting against it now. But I expect them to bring back the Citizen's Amendment Bill or something like that if they see prospects of losing elections over this. Innumerable people have already suffered and are continuing to suffer because of this ill-thought exercise in xenophobia. And, again, mainstream media is mostly ignoring it. It deserves the same attention as human rights violations in Kashmir. So what is the long term consequence of this move?.
 
1.Will Kashmiri's protest till they get self-determination?.
2.Reinstating 370?
3.Protestors will start to get tired and just accept it?
4.Paksitan wages war?
5.India gets isolated in the world stage?

Anything else?. I am just brainstorming  questions so please don't mind stupid questions  lol

That being said. All of the apathy shown among the people and the media is very saddening, MHA lied about the BBC video, indian media has become some kind of propaganda(apart from the wire, the quint, the hindu and other news channels that report the ground situation). Pakistan's ICJ lawyer Khawar Qureshi admitted that his country doesn't have evidence to back their claims of genocide in Kashmir and therefore, cannot take the case to ICJ.  This is a complete u-turn from their earlier rhetoric to having significant evidences of human rights violation in Kashmir.

Basically Pakistan in a nutshell. https://www.deccanchronicle.com/amp/nation/current-affairs/300819/kashmir-valley-to-remain-under-clampdown-for-two-more-months.html?__twitter_impression=true

4,cvlq5r,Is B.A in Political Science and Sociology and good choice or should I go for Public Administration instead of Sociology?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvlq5r/is_ba_in_political_science_and_sociology_and_good/,Political,I'm using the word good because I have interests in all 3 but can choose only two. Usually I see Political Science and Public Administration.,10," It really depends on what you want to do after graduation, or which subject you would enjoy studying more for the next few years.

I did Pol Sci. and Economics against Pol Sci and Statistics/Public Ad. My own understanding back then was that studying Economics will serve me better when I'm focusing on Political Science, especially the subjects that surround International Relations. And also because it would help me understand the subject in a better way for what I was aiming for.

Initially I thought I'd continue to do Masters but I scratched that idea away because none of the universities had any decent courses in Political Science/International Relations. I'd rather do self study for the sake of progressing the subject in my own way, and at my own pace. 

To be blunt, B.A. in India doesn't really have that scope of getting an ""A Grade salary"" right after you graduate. Of course, you could prepare for government exams like UPSC or SSC, then there's also the path of doing MBA or LLB.

If you intend to appear in government job exams then I would recommend Public Administration, it will be helpful when you're preparing for these exams. Sociology is also a decent choice, can't go wrong with it if you enjoy the subject.

So, take your time and think of what you want to do after you graduate, that way you can decide between the two. r/Indainacademia",13,0.88,1566840708.0
5,cuvhon,IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan resigns over 'lack of freedom of expression’.,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ias-officer-kannan-gopinathan-resigns-over-lack-of-freedom-of-expression/article29244029.ece,Political,,77," I don't know if I can share more information about this, 

But read about the resignation of the last FC of Indian Railways. He resigned just 3 months before his retirement. 


Guess the story I suspect some kind of misappropriation or other frivolous investigation will now be started against him by govt. No way the machine, esp. this machine, will tolerate such criticism from their own. My dad is also an IAS officer and I remember one time he and my dad were staying in the same circuit house, we went to another officer's room and the trio had a long discussion about Nehru, his vision for India, socialism, basically Indian political history. Whatever else may be true, I know for a fact that this guy is a genuine guy. He is not the bribe taking, power maximizing kind of IAS we see all too often. Given he is from Kerala, pretty sure he will be tagged as ""communist"" soon. Wake up, bhakts. You are just promoting a fascist. Bhakts in comment section : 

- Special status removal is right . This IAS officer is a leftist. He should just serve people and do what govt. asks. 

>>> He is not resigning because you took away special status of Kashmir. He is resigning because you are suppressing  voice of Kashmiris who have been impacted by this thing. 

- He lost his freedom of expression when he joined IAS. He is a govt. employee. He should just serve people.

>>> He is not resigning because his freedom of expression was lost. He is resigning because you have suppressed freedom of expression of people of Kashmir. You have arrested democratically elected members and infringing on their basic rights. 19 days since it happened and no improvement in their condition. 

My message to Bhakts - Sooner or later this will happen to a state that's not Kashmir. May be by BJP, Congress or some other government. This whole arrest thing and putting the state in curfew like situation is setting a horrifying precedence. It can happen anywhere and there will be a ready made excuse for that. Reddit is the only place that has not been taken over by the IT cell. Guys this is our space for freedom of expression. We  have to preserve this. The scale from the highest upvotes to the highest downvotes reflects the spectrum of comments ranging ranging from left wing to right wing... Meanwhile in other subs this scale would be reversed. Such freedom of expression, Much Wow /s I think we should have only one right in India. That'll be, ""Right To Opinion"". Fundamentally it will resolve most of our internal issues. IAS officers(Permanent executive) resignation has become common in our country owing to their subordination to the political executive( Politicians) since the time immemorial. Frequent transfers, suppression of freedom, stifling their voice, excessive interference by politicians into administrative matters, difference in the style of functioning between them pertaining to the policies and decisions are some of the factors responsible for their resignation in large numbers. He will start an IAS training academy now! So he got in trouble for doing relief work dressed civilian? Award wapsi like stuff, welcome to a bright political career. You can restore all their rights when you and like minded people like you get majority.

 Meanwhile, Indians in Kashmir will get their statehood sometime in near future. ( I do see the irony and depending on the people, it might take decades too ). I hope they come to terms with these new changes and be a part of rebuilding their state and contribute to the growth of the nation and their well being.

Make a special rape case bench with a judge in all courts to fast track all cases.

Online comprehensive reporting and booking of rape case to police online (Using video, app etc) operated by women in Center office - so that local police can't do dog shit for taking cases. I really don't see how we're not the rape capital. No wonder most people around the world look disgracefully at India. This is the fact and there is no denying it. Now some of you might already be calling me anti-national, traitor etc.

Problem can be tackled only if you acknowledge it first. But people here are busy in blame game and victim shaming. 366A is ""Procuration of a minor girl"" not ""Procreation of a minor girl"". Every day the shame of sharing a country with these filth is overwhelming. I can understand politicians protecting businessmen and gangsters. 

But who is protecting these common rapists. Most of these are labourers and low income people. Why are they not prosecuted and given due justice. Need a party who wants to clear this problem once and for all. Wtf that headline :( It's high time the laws against rape should be revised impactfully in India. There should be a list of all these cases. Profiling of criminal  is a high time need.

Studies about literacy rates, age, occupation, marital status etc of the convicts would be of immense help. Why do incidents like this keep happening over and over again in the NCR? What the fucking fuck are these people? This is nerve-racking horror! Just be mindful of the fact that had the punishment for rape rivalled that of murder, They would not have just let her off with a threat after raping her. This is crazy. How can people be this inhumane?

We need to:

1. Sensetize youth and old people alike about respecting boundaries with respect to a child, a girl and a women. 

2. Have serious punishment for crimes like these.

3. Have a justice system impartial and speedy enough to close these cases the correct way.

Most importantly, we need fear of law and order that no one will go unpunished. Wherever you are girl , stay strong . All I can do for you is pray for you !! Respect for law and women is severely lacking in the Hindi belt. [removed] Sex education is the need of the hour. Not just in schools and colleges. Even in workplaces. And men and women should be taught in the same room, I've noticed how in most schools and colleges, the women and men are segregated during these classes and the men hoot and whistle like it's a jolly old time at a bar. I might get downvoted, but why is every heinous rape committed in Delhi or Delhi NCR? Or adjoining states? Crime prevention a job of police department and the people around is such a failure. 

Add to that the non existent swift or otherwise justice.

Add apathy towards each other and value of others life and we got the perfect receipe for this.

8,cvj5lu,Manmohan Singh set to lose Special Protection Group cover,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/manmohan-singh-set-to-lose-spg-cover/article29254685.ece,Political,,91," Atalji's SPG cover was not removed till he died. 

This is vindictive move. 

Rajiv Gandhi's assassination could have been avoided if his SPG cover was not removed by VP Singh government. And Ornob has a full-time Z cat security detail. Is kaka trying to shut him up? Mms had started increasing the frequency of his criticism of the current clown dispensation at the same time as chickens of fucked up economy and joblessness were coming home to roost. When you refuse to give tips on reviving economy even after multiple requests from prime sinister. He should claim that he is so well-liked personally that nobody's going to bump him. But the Amit and Mohan bhagwat *need* that z plus cover. > Plans for the move raised some eyebrows within the security establishment. **One official said that while the government was technically within the law to withdraw SPG protection to any former Prime Minister, it had chosen not to do so for Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who demitted office in 2004 and had SPG protection until he passed away in 2018.** A prolonged illness had kept Vajpayee home-bound for the past decade. **Dr. Singh is more “exposed” as he frequently travels. for political engagements and was just re-elected a member of the Rajya Sabha**, the official explained.

> A retired SPG officer said the SPG cover would only be reduced on the basis of threat levels as defined in the SPG Act of 1988. *“No govt. in power would take the risk of scaling down security without analysing the threat perception closely. No govt. would like to be discredited in taking a decision purely for political considerations,”* he said, citing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, which brought much criticism to his successor V.P. Singh, whose government had withdrawn Mr. Gandhi’s SPG protection. Is the economy in such a bad condition ? There are people who like him, there are people who are disappointed in him and there are people who feel sorry for him. I doubt if anybody hates him, at least not enough to kill or hurt him. Army for a baba to damage a river. Nothing for a former PM. Vajpayee ,advani or even Murli manohar Joshi came among hit list of many organizations as they hosted trianga in Lalchowk and related to right nationalist group and rath yatra which is founding stone of our present politics......where as despite Manhoman is former pm he remaind low profile .
Based on conversation with security personnel of joshi as why he was given security despite being out of politics.
Not any personal vendetta by present govt everything is not conspiracy theory. If this isn’t simply pettiness from the part of the Modi government, then I’d say it’s a very nice and welcome move. Security arrangements are routinely reviewed by intelligence agencies based on threat perception but often get bogged down by political considerations. Vajpayee’s SPG security cover wasn’t removed even after he was bedridden purely because the Congress was gutless and knew the BJP would have made such a hue and cry about the perceived ‘insult’. 

In the case of Rajiv Gandhi, his entire security cover was withdrawn days before his assassination. Singh still has Z+ CRPF cover and since the SPG is primarily comprised of CRPF personnel, I’d say it makes much less of a difference. I’m sure the police and the security apparatus will be proactive with his protection. 

The current political climate is ripe to make structural changes like these. The Congress party no longer has the clout to fight it; and if there is anyone in Indian politics who does not actually care about security as a status symbol it’d be a technocrat like Dr. Singh. If anything it’s the SPG personnel’s loss - working with him is a breeze; he is kind and humble and nowhere will you find a more disciplined protectee who does not veer from the established security protocol unlike Modi and the Gandhis. He will continue to have Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) cover, confirmed by Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday. The ministry also clarified that the decision has come after a routine assessment of threat perception and that it is purely professional.",118,0.95,1566822008.0

It's a festival of Hindus and you are trying to tell them that they are the real villains on this day ?

It's always been this way. Everybody has been spinning news items to present a narrative for their own benefit. 

> And worst of all , the fact that my criticism of the government can lead me to prison

Online abuse, govt orchestrated harassment, threat, may be detention/house arrest in extreme cases. Prison? Not so much, except some provocative/funny posts in social network often lead to arrest which is really shocking. Yes it is. Situation is the same all over the world.There has been a concerted push all over the world to increase tribalism in the name of Nationalism and increasing vitriolic output on the social media over debate.There has been a major effort by vested parties to push a narrative that fits their agenda and the best way to avoid criticism and to be called out against it is to stifle any view counter productive to them.

The game plan is Keep them dumb and stifle opposing voices. You are not the only person with these dilemmas and doubts. I have spoken to a lot of people back home that includes members of my extended family, friends and ex-colleagues. There are primarily two types of people:

* Those who do not care about what is happening around them. They keep their eyes set on only what they need and what is important to them and their family. They do not have an interest in the economy and politics. They do not seem to have any problem. They are in fact happy and under the impression that things are getting better because:
   * India is getting stronger every day and will eventually teach Pakistan a lesson
   * Hindus are now dominating
   * All the immigrants will be soon deported
   * India is sending spacecraft to the moon and mars
   * Narendra Modi is a superman

These are the unthinking type of people. They like to go about their business, count their money, go shopping with their spouses, talk about mobile prices and latest gadgets. They are devoid of critical thinking. They like to follow. They just need a leader. They will follow anyone who appears to be strong and can make promises of prosperity.

* But there is another section of society and they are scared witless. These are the people who have taken active participation in politics and have some knowledge about the country and the world. Some want to leave India. Some want to send their kids abroad. They do not know what may possibly happen to them. They know that it is not the government or the agency but they themselves are their enemies. They know that they cannot sit quietly for long and if they speak up they might end up in police custody. They have said that the political environment is toxic. Those who are even more depressed are saying that democracy has ended in India. With the economy plummeting, the government will become severe on critics and will continue to distract the people with bigger spectacles. Yesterday it was Balakot. Today it is the abrogation of 370. Tomorrow it might be something even bigger, with even more far-reaching consequences. Most comments are asking him to move out. You can see the thick brains of these people which are indirectly proving OP right about his fears. With you, OP. I blame a lot of this on social media and the rest on people's stupidity. They have zero critical thinking abilities and eat all the propaganda spewed by the government.

However, here is how I like to look at it. The silent minority of intellectuals will eventually grow (unless there is a fascist regime ready to take over which is highly unlikely given that it's such a diverse demography). As people become more educated, facades come down and critical thinking grows (and history has been the proof of this trend) , this idiocracy would eventually calm down.

For near future, yes we need to be a little cautious. There are elements backed by pure hatred and lust for power. But then idealism has always toppled the worst dictators. So I will continue to place my faith in that very same idealism. 

And I am not moving out of my country because someone feels that they have a greater right over it. They don't! This country is as much mine and yours as it is theirs. And we shall keep our claims strong always. Do you try to understand the other POV? How tolerant is the current youth? I find today's youth more intolerant of ideological differences than in the past. Emigration is \#1 solution to all problems atleast over here. Shit seems to be spiralling downwards all over the world... World hunger and absolute poverty levels had been consistently going down every year, until 2016 I think. Since then they've been increasing every year, climate change has been proposed as the culprit. Sry can't produce sauce, too lazy rn Keep calm and NIN on This type of things mostly happen on social media platforms. 
You can have normal discussion with your friends and coworkers. I agree 101% with everything OP said. I feel the same way. Where is my country going and why can't I do much to contribute to something positive. The bias and issues you mentioned has always been there at some level. You are just more aware of it now. I'm a Canadian so I may not offer a amazing position but I'll use what I know. Pretty much you cant trust any media source at all regardless if where you are. They'll be biased whatsoever even if the government or officials aren't handing money over. Media will lean in one and only one direction to continue the narrative. I find especially in the west offering opposite opinions is very dangerous in the sense in how most people are thinking in only one way. And over here if you are intolerant your job is likely at stake. Sounds crazy but it's true. I understand what you mean by how people refuse to listen or allow even discussion of any sort. It feels like the country is only allowed to go one way. As for what facts I know I mean in Canada we dont get a ton of coverage of Indian politics (outside of the kashmir disputes) however during my time I was there a few weeks ago and the prospective of my family and their friends on moodi and his government is leaning on the side of very traditional outdated polices and also he has such control over media that he has forced out the Gandhi family from being a figurehead. He sounds like he is a very controversial leader. I find with the way he has handled certain situations he hasn't been levelheaded and unable to calm this persona of his. Tbh he seems like a total douche in real life but oh well he does differ from Trudeau (who is arguably the worst leader in Canadian history) in how he is very India first. Question is is that helping India I'm not sure. TLDR; Polarisation. You can trust The Hindu and Indian express.
You're not that special for government to care about you so don't worry. No one has any ideas left. The BJP came to the fore as being different. Now they've run out of ideas and it's only about continued control even as they extract their rent for the next 10 years or so. I mean I saw the FM asking Bank execs for ideas for the Indian economy.Like WTF?! 

In summation; Will Indian problems be solved? Nope. Will more shady people exert all sorts of social control? Yes. Can dissent survive and be debated? Nope. Can you be sensible? Unlikely. Is it likely to get worse? Very likely.

☺️ This is what happens when you start worshipping one person, party, or ideology they take you for granted.

Sad it is, but an eye opener too. Future looking bleak for our beloved democracy Can someone eli5 it for me?
Context. Easy money with no need to answer. 

Ache din and the irony of Modi i miss democracy..or atleast the illusion or hope of it. Such a shameful move by the government. And what's even more shameful is that this will be happily accepted by the majority of the people because of the propaganda machine which runs all the time in the form of news channels. Pussy move by Govt If you look at the history of the RTI Act - it was actually Kejriwal (even before he became a politician) who had protested long and hard to get it passed. I believe he was awarded the Magsayay for the same.   

On one side we have someone like him - who people only laugh at.   
On the other side, we have the ""vikas purush"" who has only played politics after taking the office - but people still worship him. I don't know what is wrong with our country. but why he looks like granny of courage the cowardly dog But but Aajtak said hindu khatre me hai?!!! This gives "" House Of Cards "" feels. Most of the Indians poverty stricken people and rural, people who lack information, are brainwashed by these politicians and hence they truly believe in 'achhe din'.... Afterall why such an amendment to the Act is needed?? those who catch the turtles must eat them, those who vote them to power must suffer them (along with those who didnt vote for them :( ) This amendment is absurd. Although I understand that the salary of officers of a statutory body shouldn't be equal to elections comminsion but this will sure make them puppets of the centew Is it weird that even democracy is feeling smothering now.
All hope is gone. I wouldn't be surprised if this govt. disbanded elections all together. This is the end of democracy. Time to migrate We have to seriously do somethings.This is preposterous. This is what happens when democracy turns into mobocarcy the tyranny of majority. I remember how Hannah arenndt prescribed the most important actions of humans as political action.

I feel somehow that all the drama of arresting him and making him into a hero by those speeches is classic co-opting by New Delhi. They're making him into a hero for the public there and hoping that the street cred he gets will translate into votes for him in the upcoming UT elections (whenever they are). It's eerily reminiscent of the British Indian Govt's attitude of building up the Congress (and specifically Gandhi) by engaging with them. jailing their leaders but not kala pani types, making deals with them etc. The most famous eg is that of Lord Irwin dealing with Gandhi one on one to settle the CDM which instantly made Gandhi extremely powerful much to the chagrin of pro British elements in India. It was still smart on the part of the Brits in hindsight. Maybe? They definitely have to.

Not as harsh as the title makes it sound. Basically same house arrest as before but in a different and bigger house. You mean house arrest right? [removed] I am failing to understand this move. Why was this necessary if they were already under house arrest. Indian government has been heavy handed in their approach, but 72 years is a long time. Yeah... this is going to get ugly. Hello fascism my old friend Wow. Ex CMs of the state are arrested. Every possible political voice will be detained. the agreement of legislative assembly is the bare minimum that people of Kashmir deserved before such a huge decision relevant to them. Now we have just ripped them off any political power. We have bulldozed one of our own people. How is that democratic. It doesn't matter that the centre has a majority. This is a matter related to a state. By any common sensical definition of democracy, this is unconstitutional. But here we are cheering the fall of our own constitution. All those cheering for this, please think how will it feel if tomorrow your state was bifurcated without taking into consultation any of your elected representatives. I guess most of us do not understand the civics 101 to care for such technicalities. What do we care about such abstract things like democracy and political voice when we don't even care about tangible things like economy and the state of our flooded cities..But hey, we have a dear leader who has finally showed them who's the daddy. So that must be good. It's ok that constitutionalities and will of the people have been circumvented. Afterall we need to get things done and not let such flimsy notions come in way of progress. So as long as something bold is done it's ok that democracy is taken away piecemeal. It was probably too good a concept for our people anyway. So, We will cheer along while we are being fucked! The day democracy died in Kashmir. No matter how you feel about the Kashmir issue this was done undemocratically and should be opposed. Let's just arrest anyone that might not agree with our laws with out breaking any laws whatsoever. This is fascism. I was wondering 

Is this the norm for all crimes ? For example  if drugs are legal in a country especially harmful ones but later the law gets changed and drugs become illegal 

Will the person who was on drugs before the law changed be arrested ? I'm curious It's funny how arrest is different to us and the rich. Modi and his wife Amit Shah have turned India into China. Fascism

Now I've realized that our System is built on an Uneducated, Morally corrupt Society and it'd be naive to think we can change the system without changing the underlying society. Fuck this country. and when I say Fuck this country in front of someone, I usually get a reply which tells me to thank the old gods and the new that this country isn't Pakistan as if it's a complement towards a land where one slap to a cow can make you evaporate from the face of this planet. We need to remove unfit policeman from their job. Why is our police force so inept? News like this makes me so angry. We need a huge reform in how our police force functions When i was young i saw the movie Anniyan. I was really split back then because i never thought vigilante action was the way forward. But in a lawless fucked up country like India, we need vigilantism is how i feel now. 

90% of machinery is corrupt and/ or inept. and the balance 10% is punished for any action they might take. 

Who is making these fuckers, who are supposed by the protectors and enforcers of law and justice accountable. they are there to serve and protect and act like fucking kings. Really really pissed off right now. 

But at least the PM of this country is gonna be headlining a popular TV show on an international channel. Great right? Fuck this country, fuck the police, fuck these MLAs and politician and fuck the people who elect them > According to government data, the number of crimes against women reported to police in India rose by 83 per cent from 2007 to 2016. Four rape complaints were reported every hour in 2016, the data showed.

> The conviction rate for crimes against women in India is very low – only 18.9 per cent and the lowest in a decade – according to the latest official crime statistics from 2016. 

More rapes being committed and yet lesser rapists are convicted. No wonder India is the most unsafe country in the world for women. We can guess what's gonna happen, the government will show their crocodile tears and call for stricter laws for rape. To hell with actually enforcing even the existing ones. This country has no future now if these things keep going

->casteism, communalism,regionalism and language conflicts

->child abuse,child labour and violence against women

->alcoholism, drug abuse and corruption

->lliteracy,proverty, unemployment and population growth

Now our beloved politicians are already Investing their power in all type of crime, misinformation to control the people.so there is no hope from them

But as a society member we failed because we choose these asshole to rule on us.even I can't blame these politicians because we choose to ignore and doing shit things to our fellow people,

Example: if a politician talk against anything like ""bihari"" migration are the reason of overcrowding in Mumbai then ""we"" started beating ""bihari"".
A politician said ""north indian"" imposing hindi to us then what we did l, we started ""hating"" to each other.

Look politicians talk shitty thing but in general we as a normal people do their shitty things.

Bottom line is that ""we are bad people"" in society.only uniform changes.
You like it or not but this the truth.
But there are always exception. This is how parts of India keeps the rape statistics much lower than actual.

Shame. [deleted]  An Allahabad High Court judge, Justice A.N. Mulla said in a judgment in 1960 or so "" I say it with all sense of responsibility that there is not a single lawless group in the whole country whose record of crime is anywhere near the record of that organized unit which is known as the Indian Police Force."" ( see [https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498181/](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498181/) ) The way police treat the common people in India is fucking scary and disgusting. It's not even easy to talk to these cunts, they talk to you as if you are the criminal. And when real local criminals talk to them, their voice comes down and they talk to them like pussies. That's the pathetic state of India. Fuck this country. Why do I feel no matter how many threads are made for discussion, strict laws are put in place, however many protests are done, dharna varna etc... no matter however many movies are put out, that small amount of people who have no conscience whatsoever will turn a blind eye to such things and just proceed to rape at their whim. And after that the people who are supposed to protect us are doing dogshit (I'm not generalizing, just for such cases). I don't even want to think about this anymore after that unnao case, disgusting..... We seriously need huge political reform in this country. We need a progressive young leader who's going to turn this country around. Yet we won't. Nothing's gonna change. The uneducated idiots on Twitter will still preach Modi, thinking he gives two shits about them. God, I'm afraid this country is never really gonna change. So much for the biggest democracy. Moral component is missing This is of course reprehensible, but not unexpected.

But as an aside, with a string of news articles like this coming out in the Western and local media, I don't envy Indians who have to deal with foreigners regularly. The reputational damage to brand India cannot be easily undone. 

Negative stereotypes tend to reinforce themselves. You can have 100 positive news coming out of the country (ISRO, reduction poverty etc.), but it's the rape stories that stick and contribute to how you're seen. Make a million laws but u can't change people's mind :'( This bunch of people called the Indian Police are the most useless people on the planet. They have more interested to take care of Azam Khan's buffaloes than serving the people. How many times will things like these happen?When will we see justice before its too late? The police in India is simply incompetent,stupid and overrun by corruption, but here if they really did arrest and charged the guy over someone alleging to have been raped 4 years ago with probably little to no evidence, it'd have the same reaction as now.",970,0.97,1564492465.0

And to Rahul Gandhi too. About time! No matter one's views, India deserves a strong  opposition. 

I'm not sure who should succeed him, but it should be a non-Gandhi who has done good work in their state and is preferably younger. Someone like Sachin Pilot? Here's the full resignation letter from Rahul Gandhi. 


>It is an honour for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation. I owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love.

>As President of the Congress Party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress President.

>Rebuilding the party requires hard decisions and numerous people will have to be made accountable for the failure of 2019. It would be unjust to hold others accountable but ignore my own responsibility as President of the party.

>Many of my colleagues suggested that I nominate the next Congress President. While it is important for someone new to lead our party, it would not be correct for me to select that person. Ours is a party with a profound history and heritage, one of struggle and dignity that I deeply respect. It is woven into the fabric of India and I trust the party will make the best decision regarding who can lead us with courage, love and fidelity.

>Immediately after resigning, I suggested to my colleagues in the Congress Working Committee that the way forward would be to entrust a group of people with the task of beginning the search for a new President. I have empowered them to do so and committed my full support to this process and a smooth transition.

>My fight has never been a simple battle for political power. I have no hatred or anger towards the BJP but every living cell in my body instinctively resists their idea of India. This resistance arises because my being is permeated with an Indian idea that is and has always been in direct conflict with theirs. This is not a new battle; it has been waged on our soil for thousands of years. Where they see differences, I see similarity. Where they see hatred, I see love. What they fear, I embrace.

>This compassionate idea permeates the hearts of millions and millions of my beloved fellow citizens. It is this idea of India that we will now vehemently defend.

>The attack on our country and our cherished Constitution that is taking place is designed to destroy the fabric of our nation. In no way, shape or form am I stepping back from this fight. I am a loyal soldier of the Congress party and a devoted son of India and will continue to serve and protect her till my last breath.


>We fought a strong and dignified election. Our campaign was one of brotherhood, tolerance and respect for all of India’s people, religions and communities. I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it. I have learned so much from the spirit and dedication of our workers and party members, men and women who have taught me about love and decency.

>A free and fair election requires the neutrality of a country’s institutions; an election cannot be fair without arbiters – a free press, an independent judiciary, and a transparent election commission that is objective and neutral. Nor can an election be free if one party has a complete monopoly on financial resources.

>We didn’t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution of which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.

>The stated objectives of the RSS, the capture of our country’s institutional structure, is now complete. Our democracy has been fundamentally weakened. There is a real danger that from now on, elections will go from being a determinant of India’s future to a mere ritual.

>This capture of power will result in unimaginable levels of violence and pain for India. Farmers, unemployed youngsters, women, tribals, Dalits and minorities are going to suffer the most. The impact on our economy and nation’s reputation will be devastating. The Prime Minister’s win does not negate the breadth of corruption allegations against him; no amount of money and propaganda can ever hide the light of the truth.

>The Indian nation must unite to reclaim and resuscitate our institutions. The instrument of this resuscitation will be the Congress party.

>To achieve this important task, the Congress Party must radically transform itself. Today the BJP is systematically crushing the voice of the Indian people. It is the duty of the Congress Party to defend these voices. India has never and will never be one voice. It is and always will be a symphony of voices. That is the true essence of Bharat Mata.


>Thank you to the thousands of Indians, both at home and abroad, who have sent me letters and messages of support. I will, of course, continue to fight for the ideals of the Congress Party with all my strength. I am available to the party whenever they require my services, input or advice. To those who support the Congress ideology, especially our dedicated and beloved karyakarta, I have absolute faith in our future and the utmost love for you. It is a habit in India that the powerful cling to power, no one sacrifices power. But we will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle. I was born a Congressman, this party has always been with me and is my life’s blood and forever that way it shall remain.

>Jai Hind. Lol. Party members are actually asking him to stay. ""After ages, I am free!"" Dibs on the seat. Have not been following Indian news much since the elections.

I guess we will all just ignore that Rahul setup that Congress data cell that basically fed them a bunch of bogus data and information which led to this poll debacle. BJP's 🌟 campanier is out. The power of marketing and pr can do, to finish off a guy forever. Seems like he is just fed up of politics , good  for him to resign. It will be interesting to see how congress will cope with the loss. No matter what people say i have utmost respect for Rahul Gandhi.....he never used crass words and never spew filth at other people and maintained his dignity throughout but alas that's just not indian politics i hope you best in life ahead. Huge loss to BJP! Time to appoint a puppet and pull the strings from behind without any accountability. Comes After 2months actually when he said he will.  Why So much of tantrum - could have been easily done. Not for long. He will courageously, efficiently and magnanimously return to save the party.

>Sonia Gandhi resisted all the pressure from ""the loyalist"" Congressmen to join the party. The Rao government was voted out in 1996. Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in the election. The BJP won 161 seats and the Congress got 140.

>Suddenly in the winters of 1997, Sonia Gandhi announced that she would campaign for the Congress party in Lok Sabha election due for March 1998. Sitaram Kesri was the Congress president at the time.

>The change in leadership equation in the Congress was swift.

>Sonia Gandhi joined the party in December 1997 at its plenary session in then Calcutta. She addressed her first election rally in Tamil Nadu, the state where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.

>In January, Sitaram Kesri welcomed the decision by Sonia Gandhi to join the Congress and campaign for the party in an interview with India Today.

Demands were being made in the Congress party asking Sitaram Kesri to hand over the reins of the party to Sonia Gandhi.

>But Sitaram Kesri, then 82, wanted to hold on for some time. He had some support in the party but the ""rebel camp"" was in majority. The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution on March 14, 1998 asking Sitaram Kesri to step down as party president.

>The transfer of power in the Congress is often termed as the bloodless coup. It was dramatic and executed by the use of force.

>Sitaram Kesri was reportedly locked in a room in the Congress headquarters on the Akbar Road in New Delhi to prevent him from creating obstacles in Sonia Gandhi entering the office of the Congress president.

>With Sitaram Kesri locked, Sonia Gandhi entered the Congress headquarters triumphant with her supporters shouting slogans.` lol. good riddance. honestly. BJP supporters (crying): Amul Baby, please don't leave. How will we win without you? :D

Seriously, Rahul and Sonia should now quit politics and leave. This is a golden opportunity for Congress to kick nepotism and dynasty politics out. If a proper new President is elected then maybe they can give the party credibility. If they elect a Gandhi-controlled robot, then the party will just sink further. This guy finally realised that politics is not his cup of tea. I don't hate him on a personal level, as he seems to be a nice person, but he is/was an absolute disaster as Congress President. Go and live a peaceful life, away from incessant hatred and bigotry. This is a land of wolves now. Permanent thailand citizen incoming India needs a reddit party. The strongest opposition! This is a perfect chance for a competent non gandhi women leader to lead a major party like congress. However unlikely it might be i think it will change our political sphere for good.

Edit: Downvoted for stating an opinion. Never change reddit. Oh, thank god! :) The greatest news you can hear. Hopefully now they can rebuild, with people who are much more competent than he was. We need a stronger opposition more than ever Finally! r/notmyjob Not GG Rahul Good for him. Thanks for the memories, Rahul. now, we can start focusing on a new face for the opposition. Best thing to happen to Rahul, Congress and also India cause you need a strong opposition. A one sided government isn't good for India. A fresh face will light the fire under BJP's ass and keep them on their toes. Finally He was never committed to it bye-bye congress, vultures are their way. About time, this is excellent news, India needs a strong opposition in the coming term, someone to question the government’s mistakes competently and not just say “CHOWKIDAR CHOR HAI” Great news.

Makes sense for him to take up the position when winds favour Congress. Priyanka or Sonia should take over. If not then someone faithful to the family can keep the seat warm till 2024. [deleted] This is just a load of bullshit. What is the use of him stepping down when the Congress is still remote controlled by Sonia Gandhi. If Rahul Gandhi steps down, the sycophantic bunch will go with Priyanka Gandhi. Congress is dead. Time for Bahujan parties to rise. Finally

Imagine losing 30% of your population with the stroke of a pen.

Jokes aside, government service will no longer be a guarantee of stability. Shit employees can and will be fired for reasons including but not limited to corruption, abuse of authority, poor performance, etc. Would also get rid of or curtail UPSC. Make different departments get people qualified for the job instead of idiots who know nothing of the subject matter but were assigned because they passed a one size fits all exam. All stupid statue/temple/memorial projects will be scrapped.

Teaching will be made a noble profession which pays well and attracts passionate candidates

**All homeopathy institutes (yes, they exist) will be shut down.** Homeopaths will lose their practice plus some fines and one tight slap from a dedicated slapping official. If they have a genuine medical degree and still practice homeopathy, they'll be jailed. 

No more 24x7 news channels on TV. Excessive hyperbole, theatrics or shouting on TV will only be allowed if all participants wear(?) the government issued dildo during the broadcast. 

I can go on and on here.... Nice thread OP! Free protein  shakes for all Legalize gay marijuana 1) No reservations. Fee structure according to family income so that even underprivileged student could study if merit is proven. 
2) Ease the  business starting process ( Currently we stand 100(?) or so )
3) Try to make our society carbon neutral. ( Company Policies , planting trees) 
These will be my top priorities.
4) Graduation criteria if you want to become a MLA , MP. Even as a dictator it won't be easy to rule 1.3 billion people. so i will create an illusion of democracy so that the country won't turn against me. 

first of all i will buy out all the news channels.they will cover me 24*7. they will vehemently praise whatever steps i take in their newshour debates.they will promote nationalism as never before and use it every time to defend me.i will also inflame the hate against pakistan even more, so that even if there are any policy failures i can quickly distract the public. a cyber fan army would also be created along with this so that any one who raises voices against me is bullied and silenced.all the celebrity twitter handles will be actively involved in pushing my propaganda. 


i will understand that money still would hold the power so i would befriend the super rich.they will be given whatever they ask ,-huge ass sums of cash in the name of loans from public banks which they never need to pay back,military & arms deal, ownership of public undertakings etc etc.  
i would understand that religion would be a very useful tool to manipulate the masses by igniting fear and hatred. i will use it whenever it suits me.

 
the parliament would be still functioning for name sake. all bills will be passed without much discussion. the media will praise it as the most functioning and speedy parliament in the history of the country.i will still allow RTI in the country but full powers to appoint the officers will be vested with me.   

in short my dictatorship will be entirely different from now, not at all similar to the wonderful democracy we have today. * Get all political leaders to fight to the death on national TV then execute the winners on the season finale.

* Fast-track courts and justice procedures. 

* No religious bullshit tolerated. 

* Focus on science and economy. 

* No racism, castism, or any kind of discrimination would be tolerated.

* Focus on fighting climate change. 

* The pay of higher executives would be regulated.

* Mandatory 1 year service in the Indian Armed Forces for everyone once they turn 18. Pogroms obviously , for all people judging people by their surname Read and fully implement the Rules for Rulers .. https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs National water network. Let the water from Ganga and Brahmputra flow into the dry regions (via canals) such as Vidarbha, North Karnataka and other plateau regions for agriculture and what not. People will need to pass basic common sense and general knowledge tests to be able to get on the Internet. ban elections I will enact these changes through my dictatorship and then give the power back to the people:

* Every politician in the country and members of political parties will be issued a card, call it PolCard, that identifies their status as a political actor in the country. Anyone new wanting to run in an election or join a political party must first register as a politician and get their PolCard. No person without the card can run for office or be a member of any political party. 

* By registering as a politician, you give away your right to privacy in terms of banking and finances. All your personal and professional accounts will be linked to your PolCard, and all your transaction history will be visible to anyone upon request. Holding any secretive or undisclosed accounts will result in the cancellation of your PolCard and your status as a politician in the country, meaning you can no longer run for elections or be a member of any political party ever.

* Every political party in the country must also disclose all their banking and finances. All their transaction history will be made visible to anyone upon request. Holding secretive or undisclosed accounts will lead to the banning of the party from participating in the current election cycle (local or central), meaning no members from the party can run for office under the party's name; they may run as independents or as members of a different political party. 

* Every civil servant in the country, except for judges, from postman, peons to police officers, will become part of a database with a rating system, in which every Indian citizen can rate any individual civil servant they may encounter in their day to day lives. The rating system will be multifaceted, for example one can rate down, say, a staff at the passport office for being rude or inefficient. Those who have unsatisfactory ratings will be subjected to review or sacking by the appropriate authority. This will be implemented essentially as a app, where an Indian citizen can use their Aadhar identification to get access to the database, search for a civil servant and rate them. It will be possible for someone to rate a civil servant low by mentioning bribery as the primary reason. 

* Every Indian citizen will be given a new duty, which is as follows: once a year at random you will get a letter from the anti-corruption commission, which will specify you a task where you will be required to go to a government office and report on the state of bribery/corruption in the office. For example, you may receive a letter telling you to go to a specific police station in your area and make a complaint - the details of all this will be given in the letter. You are then to report on the state of corruption in the police station. Along with the letter, you will receive a survey sheet, in which you are to make your report and post it back. If you find someone taking bribery, you can make an accusation in the report, and the anti-corruption commission will take action. A particular government office, be it police station, post office, RTO etc., that gets a lot of bad reports/bribery accusation will be ripped to pieces by the anti-corruption commission.

I will make all these changes constitutional, i.e., I will make these changes and the principle behind them a part of the constitution. * Implement Uniform Civil Code 
* Implement Western secularism (separation of the state and religion) 
* Mandatory 10-12 years of elementary education for children 
* Invest heavily in quality education and impart an education that develops scientific temper 
* Invest in infrastructural projects and streamline the bureaucracy 
* Minimum 80% cut-off in class 12th to enrol in Engineering courses 
* One child policy for 20-30 years 
* Life imprisonment for female foeticide and infanticide 
* Get rid of stupid colonial laws 
* Legalize marijuana 
* Death penalty for animal poachers 
* Ban dumping of dead bodies in Ganga-Yamuna 
* Get rid of stupid Soviet socialist policies 
* Ban pseudosciences like astrology, homoeopathy and the like 
* Make a 2nd Capital city somewhere on the Eastern coastline (AP or Orissa) 
* Increase the number of nuclear warheads including tactical nukes 
* Get my own private island(s) in the Andaman or wherever with a modern resort, amusement park n shit 
* My own private hill station 
* Fuck bitches 
* Go for joyrides in fighter jets 
* Slap, kick and punch Bollywood celebs for shits and giggles

* Profit * Get Mukesh Ambani, Gopal Vittal &  Sunil Sood to give a backdoor access to their networks
* Establish a call center lookalike to peek at calls of all politicians and important people
* Execute all politicians over night for corruption
* Form a one party rule with no other political party or ideologies in existence
* Train the army and build a black ops police force to curb any aggression against the party, a patriotic army is what keeps a dictatorship alive
* Spend on media to encourage people to be on the offensive against anyone who does not agree with the parties values and making them believe that they are actively working against the nation's interests
* The Focus of the party will be on 5 things - Economy, Education, Environment, Infrastructure & Law  
**---Economy--**
* Govt expenditure will be controlled heavily (I know investment is needed in the short term) but for the long term, there will be massive disinvestment in PSUs
* Banks, BSNL & MTNL and other non profitable govt units will be sold off to stop the massive cash drainage
* Reduce foreign aid to a minimum, take all the aid you can and stop imports of all agricultural produce
* Get Farmers to grow all kinds of crops and provide them with technical know how and allow them to sell directly to the consumers by abolishing APMC to cover for the reduction in imports, cutting off the middlemen will drastically improve the situation of the farmers (currently a farmers sells a kilo of produce for as little as Rs. 2 which is bought by the consumers at Rs. 20)
* Abolish several Pradhan Mantri XYZ Scheme thats basically a free handout to the people
* The reduction in govt expenditure will allow the govt to reduce tax rates encouraging the private sector to invest more
* Govt will follow through the sovereign bonds and raise the foreign debt to 15% of GDP (from current below 5%) and invest in infrastructure  
**--Education--**
* The entire nation will follow the same pattern - no local universities with everyone offering different things
* Change the entire syllabus, the children will learn 3 languages - English, Hindi and the local state language across the country
* The local language and hindi will only be till the 7th grade
* Children will be taught how to code
* The stories behind how something was developed will be shared and not just the end result, so the students don't just mug things up and understand the importance of things they learn and their practical application
* When i was in 8th grade, we used to have standard deductions in essays, byheart ""muhavra"" in hindi and marathi and basically spit all of it out on the exam paper - all of this will cease to exist
* Teaching will become a noble passion - their qualification will be tougher and they will be paid handsomely
* Current HRD minister will be fired  
**--Environment--**  
* Firecrackers will be banned completely
* Rain water harvesting will be encouraged throughout the country
* Holi will be dry
* Rivers will be cleaned so that oceans are no longer being polluted / Get a few snipers to roam the banks with license to kill
* Plastic will be banned in almost all cases
* FMCG Goods packaging will be reduced; See : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcnAYdrV074  
* Large appliances sellers will be required to take the packaging and thermocol they ship with their product to be collected back by the delivery people and reused for other products
* Indore's garbage disposable mechanism will be taken on a national level; See : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MS8vfcTmSM  
**--Infrastructure--**  
* All the money govt saved in on the disinvestment will be used to fund the infrastructure projects  
* Railways will be electrified, unprofitable rail lines shut down and increase fines for those that travel with tickets upto 10,000 and increase monitoring by TCs
* As someone who travels via train in extreme crowds, First Class compartments and Disabled compartments will be removed in favor of normal compartments, Trains will have 15 coaches and to accomodate that platforms will be longer
* Newly made roads affected by potholes will result in death of contractors  
**--Law--**
* Greater focus on gender neutrality - all laws will be gender neutral and applicable to both genders with same punishments
* Men usually receive greater punishments for similar crimes - a team will be setup to examine punishments given by judges and discard biased judges
* Prenups will be mandatory in all marriages - Divorce will no longer be a get rich instantly card
* Judges will no longer be appointed on basis of years of experience and will be done so on basis of merit
* More courts to fast forward the amount of cases pending (There are about 1 crore cases pending in all the courts in India)
* Steps will be taken to ensure anyone who falls a victim to a crime today gets justice tomorrow and not 10 years later The first thing I would do is increase our awareness about “dignity of labour” Death penalty for littering Public executions motherfuckers.

Everyone needs to sing my praise at the starting of the day..

Everyone needs to have the exact same haircut as i have..

Pros:
There will be government subsidised fidget spinners for everyone.. No more caste based reservation.

In education, change syllabuses to a more practical approach. Industries wont hire students from colleges that do rote learning and write files and assignments while listening to music.

Aaaand promote more lecturers [like this](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSocial/comments/cogd9o/raavishree_ambiger_raavishree/) (nsfw) Mudi Ji is already doing it. Ban quorans invading Reddit Not muzzle opinion or voices ..no 50 Crore worthless spendings on statues  which in 5 to 10 years turns into a dumping ground , use that money towards uplifting people  , improving roads , infrastructure ,govt 🏫 s , toilets ... I'd make the primary school education accessible for everyone because school is where children explore their interests,get inspired and work on them. Radical reform in police & judiciary Dictators are considered as bad guys in our time. So, I'll become the chairman of the Election and Executive Commission of India (EECI). There will be a prime minister and a cabinet too along with all the bags and baggages of democracy like Parliament and political parties etc.

Every decision taken by the Parliament, cabinet or the PM must be send to the EECI for approval before becoming a law or a government order. Every advice coming from the EECI should be followed by the government.

Every election will be done via EVM and all elections will be held in a single day and fully controlled by EECI. So, it will be easier to manage.

All the senior leaders of the current political parties will be given handsome pensions and great retirement benefits. They will be freed from their burden of running political parties so that they can rest peacefully at home. Plenty of intelligence officers and secret police will provide security to them.

The new leaders will be selected and promoted by the ECCI secretly for the wellbeing of the nation.

There will be complete freedom of press. To preserve neutrality, biased news outlets will be banned. No corporate or politically funded news outlet will be allowed to function. Every news outlet will get handsome monetary help from EECI.

Freedom of Speech of the citizens will be respected. Aadhar should be linked with every social media account. However, anyone spreading hatred, falsehood or fake news will be captured and imprisoned with quick trial.

I love democracy. Digitalization of all govt process and hiring programmer to mine data and find tax Invaders and corrupt govt officials. 

If you are caught doing wrong heavy monetary fines or trip to work camp. Make a thief cum mass murderer the face of the country. Reading idiotic comments here just make me glad these fuckers are not running country and India is a democracy . Seriously some comments are so idiotic and impractical. Modi taking notes implement /r/neoliberal. Ban floods and draughts 1. Heavy traffic fines based on their ITR, a person earning more get heavier fine. 
2. Introduce points on driving licence for traffic violations and after accumulation of certain points the DL gets cancelled.
3. For all the above to work either the police has to be efficient and do their duty with corruption or else these should be an automated camera system like Dubai. For the former to work we neet to give incentive to traffic cops on each fines they process SUCCESSFULLY.
4. Move towards a digital India will more incentive for business and customers to use digital/wallets instead of cash. 
5. More jobs or atleast give opportunity to unemployment youth to start their own business. The main reason for all these thugs or goons creating a bad name for India is due to unemployment. 
6. Corruption: this is the biggest problem plaguing India and to eradicate this the people accepting brides have to be actually scared of losing their jobs just like in private sector. So any proven corruption case will directly lead to a termination. 
 

These above and some other changes will create a domino effect and definely make India better they what it is now.  

No need to get offended these areul my views alone. Lay foundation for a better democracy Ban, just whatever comes to mind, including Reddit NCC compulsory in every educational institution India is a big country already in terms of size so i would stop encroaching our neibour countries land and waterways.. * Tax everything religious. All centers of idiocy like mosques and temples to be government controlled. 
* Build an Atheist History museum instead of le Ram Temple.
* Build science centers everywhere having libraries, laboratories, computers etc. to popularize science education and make it possible for students, no matter their  to pursue their interests.
* The ministry of AYUSH will be disbanded and all alternative medicine quacks will have whatever licences they have revoked. Jail terms and fines abound.
* Gyms, Parks, Playgrounds. 
* Digitize everything. No 1984-type shit though, apart from whatever's there already. 
* Dissolve the CBFC. 
* No more honking and high beams. Super difficult driving licence exams.
* <Insert magical solution to corruption here.>
* You get Public Transport, and you get Public Transport. Everyone gets Public Transport!
* No religious shit in public. Fuck your traditions and culture.
* Gender-neutral laws.  
* Full support for the LGBT+ community.
* UCC. No personal laws or personal law boards. 
* LOC is the international border. India delivers an apology to the Kashmiri people, and all right-wingers who love to call themselves nationalists will have to spend 1 year helping Kashmir. Patrols, administration, sanitation, labour, art, whatever skills they have will be used for the development of the region. They'll be given a participation certificate and a thanks from the government at the end of the year. Nothing else.
* All BJP/Congress/etc. members sent to Siachen for vacations. Bye. Don't come back.
* amazarashi's Karappo no Sora ni Tsubusareru is the national song. All students are required to learn it, instruments and all. It will be played everywhere on 29 March.
* Build statues of mythological and fictional figures from all around the world in a city specifically created for this purpose. In Gujarat. The smallest statues will be of Jesus and Ram(They already have other ones don't they?). Tallest for Indra cursed with Sahasra Yoni and second-tallest for Fingolfin, the most metal elf to ever exist.
* Government officials have to wear rainbow colored clothes on Monday. Pride flag waving on Tuesday afternoon.",44,0.79,1565527600.0

Ravish Kumar systematically takes down the PM's interview with Akshay Kumar using satire and mangoes effectively.

""Today I want to talk about non-political things. I do not want to talk politically. I am bored of political talk. I thought I would do something non-political. Do something in which there is no politics. The election is too long. Reporters are also tired. Some reporters did not get a hold of Modi-Modi from the outside and returned. The reporters bent their heads when the editor asked for the budget.""

""Then another reporter was sent. They placed their ear to the ground. Listened to the under-current. This is the change in 2019. The current is underground. Instead of waves there are under-currents now. Underneath the ripple has come. Lou runs above, the undercurrent runs below. So thought that when politics is not happening in the season of politics, then in this season we get out of politics. To do something different.""

Getting the two obvious ones out of the way


Anupam Kher,BJP: husband of a BJP politician Kiron kher and has vehemently defended BJP idealogy publically 


Arnab Goswami,BJP: Runs a news channel Repulic TV in partnership with BJP MP. TV Debate on the channel target other parties excessively",62," Anupam Kher  - wife supporter like every man should be. ;-) Vishal Dadlani AAP Radhika Roy founder of NDTV is sister of Brinda Karat, MP from CPI(M).

Subash Chandra founder of Essel group which includes Zee News, is a MP from Haryana with support from BJP in Rajya sabha. I respect people like Kher more than Amitabh Bachchan, at least we know where their loyalty lies.

Amitabh has been a Cong MP in 80s.

Then was close to Amar Singh and SP in later 90s and early 200s. Wife is still SP MP.

Became close to Modi when he started to rise.

Now hearing he's going back to cong as we speak.

 Ambani bhool gaye Sudhir Chaudhary - Zee TV. Prakash Raj - Congress  Prannoy Roy, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose - all Congress  i have been curious about this. most americans openly identify with one of the two (mostly) political parties... i wonder if it means that they are officially a member of that party or they just prefer them over others... it would have been nice if this was the case here as well. would have been easier to decide who to avoid and who not to looking at how things are here in this country.  Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all. Randeep Hooda, Virender Sehwag - BJP Me What is this for? End purpose? Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys is a rabid BJP supporter, just like most bigots in India. A-grade hypocrite too. Gautam Gambhir- BJP I only started following politics after the Nuclear Deal, so don't have historical opinions.

52,8gwqi3,[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,Non-political,,207," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos.

Cleverest people , if all mumbai and suburban trains do this , half the problems will be solved . nice post Kaun hai yeh log, kahan se aatey hain ye log? This is common in mumbai at bus stops. In fact no where in India do people 'follow traffic rules' as much as mumbai in my experience.  What alternate universe is this? Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........  Security staff in Bengaluru metro makes people queue up like this. All of that vanishes once the train arrives lmao Yeh kabse hone laga yaha??? 😯😯  Nice editzz Queing for reserved ticket isn't a big deal. But for local it is.

Back in 1990, while being transferred to the spot where it currently stands, the statue slipped and fell into the water body. Taking the lives of 10 people in the accident. The statue remained under water for 2 years before it was pulled back and erected to where we now see it. Year by year dumping Ganesh idols has made this into a garbage lake. The water is actually dark green in colour accompanied with exotic smells. Don't go by this picture! Bund = Ass (in punjabi) Necklace road right? Had my first kiss around here. Good memories.

An alternate way of living. And it is saying that it's my current way of living which is delusional instead. To make things clear, I'm referring to illusion by the word delusional. 
I should give you a perspective. I feel I should run away from the current way of life because it is a lot of words and symbols. Like job, future, girlfriend, career, love from other people, wanting to become a writer, wanting to buy latest and most advanced mobile phone and TV etc. I feel like starting from the scratch and rejecting everything world has to offer. I know a few places where even food and living won't be problem. There's therefore this conflict I'm going through therefore.",15," Buddy it's that phase of life where you gotta sit and revisit some recent decisions that may have led you to this situation, there is nothing more to it unless you let it get to you. Thanks for checking on yourself and talking about it.

Firstly **forgive** yourself if you think you have done something wrong and in case your social environment has led you to this situation then try and **forget** it. 

The forgive and forget part is crucial, after this just spend a day or two like you usually do and see if it still makes you feel delusional. 

Finally if you still feel delusional then the you gotta consult doctor which is for the best. Absolutely nothing wrong with taking care of your mental health, we often seem to ignore it and make it worse. This is called depression.  Yes, go visit a psychiatrist before it turns into full fledged psychosis. Please visit a psychiatrist and talk about this. That's the best way to get a professional opinion on whether there are any underlying issues.

Also remove any taboo that you may have associated with mental sickness. The mind, like the body can also get sick and there is nothing wrong with it. Dude, this is completely normal! I get these thoughts every morning... But things go normal after breakfast, and when I have to take public transport to office! You mean you’re going through adolescence? Let me get this straight.You realised that the world you live in is revolving around a few words and symbols.You feel that the performances are meaningless or Do you feel that the whole  thing is overwhelming?

I think there's more to it than you've presented. In any case, running away is usually a sub-optimal solution.Think critically, or get somebody who is an expert in critical thinking to help you unpack your idea - possibly a counselling psychologist. Fyki , being a sadhu is not a solution . Its a big scam. Just wondering you username Where is such a place? Like an ashram or some such?  What if you change your mind in the future? There will be no going back. I'd suggest being a part of this world while not consuming all of it if you so wish. Just collect enough resources to live comfortably.",37,0.88,1548558068.0
61,b6uzbt,"[serious] [reddiquette] [askindia] March End woes, questions regarding rent receipt submission and taxation and legalities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6uzbt/serious_reddiquette_askindia_march_end_woes/,Reddiquette,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",0,,7,0.89,1553879497.0

63,7h2uhv,[Reddiquette] Rant about quora,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7h2uhv/reddiquette_rant_about_quora/,Reddiquette,"Let me begin by clearing why I use quora. While reddit is great for asking question on various communities, quora is the only place where I can get unironic answers for my questions related to various exams conducted in India. 


But what is up with these Indian quora users? Do they really think that giving a really long answer would make up for the lack of attention they received from the opposite gender in their school college. What is inhibiting them from giving a straight and concise answer to simple straight forward question. 


Now I know that there are quorans who wave around their degrees from IITs and IIMs, but truth be told, rarely I have seen an IIM grad irl who gives such long and lofty answer to anything. They keep it short and simple. The same cannot be said about IITians. Yes I know you worked hard to get where you are, but you don't have to rub it in on someone who doesn't care about your degree and is just here for clearing something up.

Coming back to the rant, does every answer need to be an essay on your life? Also, if I am asking an insightful/technical question of which I happen to know somethings  I am really interested in what I asked. I don't want the googled textbook definition  that you ripped off from a website to sound smart and I certainly don't need all the background information on the topic. For example, I recently came across a question asking if Arnab Goswami is a liberal or conservative. Now this randi quoran gave a 200 word explanation on what it means to be a liberal and a conservative. And then went on to the function of the government. In the final sentence was his answer. THE  ANSWER NEEDED WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE and he wrote 500 word essay. 


Also, the whole of quora is the r/askreddit sub. All the question that get answered are the questions which have nothing insightful.  I remember asking a question about the Rakhine situation, and ended up getting answers from an extremely xenophobic dude, who ranted how all bangladeshis should be killed who come to India. I mean dude, can you even read. I just asked why Myanmar refused to accept Rohingya as it's residents.


Also, what is up with these teenagers giving out life lessons?  They are 18 ffs. They have barely even experienced it. 

Tl:dr; Rants of a madman on quora users. I know there are subreddits such as r/indianpeoplequora and r/rant , however I chose this subreddit since the people at r/rant won't get what I am on about and it isn't exacty r/indianpeoplequora material.",28," Just use it for your competitive exam related queries and don't use it for anything else. I have facebook just to send some messages or attachments incase whatsapp does not work, don't use it otherwise. 

Edit: Adding to what I said, no site is 100% useful, reddit has lots of shit floating around (in fact I would say majority of reddit is absolute shithole) but we only visit the good parts. Its true for most things in life, use the parts which are useful to you, don't use the rest.  Here's how I use quora, if I have a question I google it. If a quora link comes up as a search result then read answers otherwise don't go to quora.  Mate you have to block like, every single Indian author on Quora along with “India” topic. This is the only way to reduce shit from coming up on your news feed. It took me few hours but it was worth the effort.  on quora, you will notice young people are giving life lessons, advices, experiences.......(which you normally expect from elders)

I' be like ""itna experience laatein kahaan se yeh bachhe""
 Not to mention when indian sapios try to write sarcastic answers when somebody    asks questions about how they are in depression and feeling suicidal. Ah. Nice rant. Let me tell you a story of when I was in IIT Kharagpur 2 years back. ..... r/indianpeoplequora [deleted] a girl once told me that she is cheif on some topic on quora . i have stoppedtalking to her since The psyche of Indians is very limited and this is the fault of our education. I left Quora because of these sapiosexual types increasing in number. I get that you can be sometimes proud of your college or whatever, but to make it as an identity throughout your life is limiting yourself as getting into IITs becomes your sole highest achievement of your life.

This is exactly reflected in Quora and other sites.

Although, I don't want to stereotype every Quora Indian. There are some people who have lived their substantial adult working life in the USA or some other country and still give biased answers against Muslims or minorities of the country they live in etc. This is what is really disheartening. 1.) Qualifications are the only thing most Indians can boast about to compensate for small penis/ovaries or a lack of a non-curated life brought to you by their parents. 

2.) Check the answer, if it has too many links. Then it's just someone trying to get the tiny link juice their SEO achieves from Quora. If that's the case Harsh Agarwal's ShoutMeLoud army at work.
 I found it similar to what you describe however it takes time to correct your feed.

1. Downvote or report every answer you dont think is good enough. Give reasons for reporting. I found out after a few days of downvoting my content changed dramatically.
Indians overtake your feed if you dont downvote or mute them.

2. Follow different authors or accounts. Most Indian authors write similar and it gets boring very quickly.

3. Its changing to a author-centric site as someone mentioned to a collection of people's experiences. If you like reading about them give it a try. I recently followed a guy who used to work in Russian propoganda ministry. Its fascinating to see his writing.

Quora is now mostly a site for people to share their experiences. Factual answers pop up very less. If you like such content, give it a try. Horny saapio virgins trying hard to get into someone's pants. [deleted] Use the mute button liberally.  Isn't your rant a long essay? ",68,0.83,1512253133.0

67,2dbsis,[Np] Reddiquette. You Should Know : The largest combined arms operation after WW2 that resulted in the largest number of prisoners gained after WW2. India's brilliant victory in the 1971 war.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2dbsis/np_reddiquette_you_should_know_the_largest/,Reddiquette,"The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.


It is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was, 


Attack on a broad front > use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line > Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .


India which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.


**The Planning:**


In March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan.  Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi  and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.


•	The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.

•	Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging & fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.

•	The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.

Indira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK & France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms & ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)


Mankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.


**Order Of Battle**


The OOB was as follows, Eastern Command > 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) > 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). 
Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.


The odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.


The Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.


**The Indian Plan**

It was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh. 

There was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka. 

J.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.


**The Pakistani Plan**

Counter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars). 

In Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges). 

The idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)


**The War**

•	3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.


•	In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector. 

•	In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens. 


The Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.


**Psycops**


The Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.

Even back then, we were spammers.

Great read, though. /r/depthhub Thanks for this awesome post!. I want to know more about Warfare, can you suggest me some books that i can read ? 
  Don't 4get the brilliant operations Trident and Python of the Navy. V crippled the enemy and took no casualties in both operation.  Excellent post! Sam Manekshaw, JFR Jacob, PC Lal... the armed forces were exceptionally well led in that war!

You should start a blog. Reach a wider audience.  Pakistan got spanked in this war, no other way to put it. But aside from the loss of life, I'm glad we lost. Bangladesh should never have been part of Pakistan in the first place, and our leaders were doing them no favors. I don't know how true it is, but a lot of people say that during the war, General Yahya Khan was busy drinking and womanizing.  Thanks for the post. I was really looking forward to read this post once I reach home after work. Why the hell is this stuff not taught in schools. According to our text books we have absolutely no history after gaining independence.

You could have made this post on Independence day. Now you must post another one.  What? No reference to Heinz Guderian in maneuver warfare?! Poda!

But great post though! Interesting read, thanks for this. You should add some sources for further reading.

I read about [Sam Manekshaw](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Manekshaw) yesterday, extraordinary individual with a very decorated history. He even served against imperial Japan in WW2. The Soviet Union was also critical to this victory.  Nixon had sent the 7th Fleet into the Bay of Bengal on day 2 to shut down the Indian offensive via aerial and naval bombardment, but the USSR sent a nuclear sub to tail them, implicitly threatening nuclear war should Nixon do so. Gee thnx OP , not only did you mesmerize me with your narration, you have now I have all these books I want to read !

but seriously, thank you , this was brilliant. I saw a brilliant movie 1971, damn the ending still tears me up. What a brilliant actor Manoj Bajpayee is. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKHd6eZ4TLQ Since a number of people over here are asking for further reads, I would recommend this excellent book - ['The Blood Telegram'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Blood-Telegram-Kissinger-Forgotten/dp/0307700208), less from the Indian perspective, and more of Nixon's phobia towards India, and the resulting policies. I have somewhere read that one of the long term mistakes India made during the war was not capturing Pak/ Kashmir territory when they had the chance (as spoils of war) and instead retreating back to pre war positions, this squandered our effort and gains in the long term Okay I have a mildly irrelevant question: weren't Sam Manekshaw and Cariappa Field Marshals at the same time?  Thank you for this excellent analysis. [A life lived such - Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmPmm7QeIE) While I knew that the 71 war had created one of the largest number of PoWs, the detailed post really gave a lot of insights about the actions on ground. Thanks! Thanks a lot for this. I am very poor when it comes to history like this. Could you hyper link your sources? That way I can find related stuff on the internet. Thanks again. This is the kind of post I want to see in r/India. I love you guys. You should read Col. [David Glantz](http://www.great-victory1945.ru/glantz_3.htm) books/articles on WW2 conflict between USSR and German/Axis powers.

More recently [air cavalry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_assault) concept from Vietnam War and [Air-Land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirLand_Battle) and [Air-Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirSea_Battle) battle doctrine of US 

Some of your analogies to WW2 Germany and USSR could be more nuanced. While principles of maneuver warfare have been around and employed, there is a sea change between nazi doctrine (which was an amorphous collections of principles, often aiming to create a Kesselschlact (battle cauldron) and identifying the SchwerPunkt (focal point of attack) and Soviet combined arms doctrine. These also evolved over time, example [the first battle of smolensk was a disaster for Soviets, as Stalin insisted that they not retreat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Smolensk_\(1941\)) 

1971 Also saw one place in the east where the Indian army had a heavy slog of it with a more or less direct assault against a tenacious Pakistani commander who had taken advantage of local terrain (ditches etc)  . Will try to locate the reference from Bharat Rakshak or wiki. 

Pakistan strategy that defence of the east ""lies in the west"" and reliance on foreign support was shattered by the speed and preparedness of the Indian assault in the east, able diplomacy by India, local support by Mukti Bahini, and sufficient counterblow in the west to create a stalemate there. You might want to make more of a point of it.

One very minor mistake in a good post is the reference to Hitler's mistake in not manning the city of Berlin. This is an underappreciation of the situation at the end of the war and the local geography/times. The battle of berlin was conducted at natural fortification just outside and was one of the bloodiest and desperate battles of WW2. 

Also of note - The Burma campaign that turned back the japanese army has been cited as one of the largest defeats of the Japanese army ever. (guadalacanal was comparable, but viewed as less strategic and including japanese navy). The battle of Imphal and Kohima are under-rated, as is the achievement of the Chindits. Truly, this is the forgotten war. Perhaps partly because it was a British Indian army with british commanders, partly because the Japanese were at the end of their supply lines, partly because Bose was on the other side.  

The battle of [Keren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Keren) (a predecessor of Monte Cassino and Tiger Hill) , and other british indian exploits too warrant mentioning.

Neverthless the 1971 war was extremely notable, for all the reasons you mention and more. Great research but couple of points:

* The Maneckshaw offering to resign thing seems blown out of proportion. No one would seriously suggest attacking rainy flood-prone land in the monsoon. Since time immemorial monsoon has been off season for wars in India.

* All your references are by Indian writers who were actors in the war. ""Major element of genius provided by J.S. Arora"" and written about by J.S. Arora, am I right. Every decision victors make in a war becomes one of genius especially when victors write it. You should read some neutral reports. 

* I believe ""Slender was the Thread"" is about the 47-48 war and does not count here. INDIA IS DA BEST. SO PROUD OF MY CUNTRY.",162,0.93,1407872937.0
68,2chvdi,Serious Question to AAP supporters. [Reddiquette],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chvdi/serious_question_to_aap_supporters_reddiquette/,Reddiquette,"Do you folks support AK or AAP and what it stands for? If tomorrow in a hypothetical world, the top 4 in AAP get removed in an intra party coup, would you still support AAP?

Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental? 

",223," I was a big AAP supporter and supported the idea behind it. Almost everything AK did pre-Delhi elections was in line with the idea. He then tried to become a politician. Something he is not good at. Congress dragged him to their level and beat him at it.

The coalition with Congress was his political hara-kiri. I support AAP in general, although I think AK is the main driving force in the party. I would still support them if the top 4 get removed, because I think they believe in something, and if they follow the same policies, I am fine with it. Although, I think AK is the reason they draw such crowds, he is pretty good at what he does.

Although I may disagree with some of their policies such as the anti-nuclear power stand. Also the unnecessary support for Gaza.

I still think they are the best thing to have happened to Indian politics. Being clean and corruption free is the most important thing, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, that is not the case in India. The corrupt and the thugs are rewarded, while the nice guys are sidelined. AAP is really necessary in Indian politics, more to keep the main parties in check.

AAP is the only party in support of bringing accountability for political parties. Both BJP and congress will never support RTI for political parties.

AAP is the only party which seriously opposes criminality in politics. You can see the hypocrisy in both BJP and congress where they provide lip service but when its their turn to implement it, they'll say its just ""politics"".

So as long as AK/AAP stand for cleaning up politics and jail the corrupt politicians, I will support them. We need AAP.

This is how electoral discourse happens in India now :

> INC: Hey BJP, You did X. That is bad.

> BJP: But INC, you did Y. Which is worse.

At the end, nothing gets done about X or Y. The two parties replace talking about the issues & instead talk about which 1 is holier.

AAP, with small history, can break this cycle. I will support anyone which brings the bill of swaraj.  As for Ak and just modi..  I some how trust them both to take a decision for the nation.  I didn't have that feeling for Congress or shiv sena or any other party. 

Some how after modi is done,  I don't trust anyone.. 

Ak has had for long been against the government and now he is trying to be the government to change it.  

If the 49 days was any indication then I will for a thousand times donate and trust them with my vote  [deleted] >Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental?

It's the other way around. If AAP had some other leader I would still support. However, AK turns out to be quite an able administrator, apart from a few things like showbaazi and stuff. Having known his history and achievements, I can assuredly put my faith in him to do what he believes in. 

Transparency in functioning, anti-corruption stance, RTI, right to recall are all the principles that I strongly subscribe to and there I am not aware of a single political party that stands for them other than AAP. It's really the lack (or even the presence) of a non-shady political party that makes my support for AAP stronger.  

And as long as the core principles of AAP remain the same, any fallouts in the leadership is not gonna affect my support. I personally support the founding principles of AAP, to be a force to end corruption and bring accountability to government functioning.  I also think that both BJP and Congress are corrupt (to varying degrees), and don't have any incentive to end corruption.

I think a party like AAP even if they don't win a majority can be a voice of reason within the parliament.

So regarding your first query, I will keep supporting AAP through donations because they are my only source of hope in this muddled democracy.

As far as AK is concerned, I don't think he is a power-hungry maniac as some people tend to believe. They did make some mistakes like resigning from the Delhi government and trying to fight across India in general elections.

He basically tried to expand too fast, without having a robust fundamental structure in place. He failed. Many people saw this as an excellent opportunity to hit him when he is down. Obviously, pissing off the media and industrialists like Mukesh Ambani did little good. They went after him when they saw the opportunity post-elections.

I strongly believe he has the best interests of the country in mind. I also believe is a man of high integrity. He is interlinked with the AAP movement, and there is no separating the two.

So yes, I will keep supporting AK as well.
 yes i will still support AAP if it is lead by a person of clean image.I see only changing the current political scenario as respite from my troubles.the JLB,swaraj and their transparency regarding funds is good. TBH I don't support AAP. I just don't think they deserve much of the hate they get based on no facts. So to clear a few things:

1. AAP is no more a Congress B-Team than BJP
2. AAP is not full of Kashmir separatists
3. AAP is not a Maoist party

I have no idea how people believe all this crap. [deleted] [deleted] I support Both AAP and AK. both go hand in hand. Question is asked to create a distinction between AK and AAP. I hope you are not Arnab Goswami. 
 [Reddiquette] does nothing, it should be [R]

And with the Politics tag, you cannot have a [R] enforced thread, unless something changed I will always support AK.

I request all to **plzzzz** read this http://www.rmaf.org.ph/newrmaf/main/awardees/awardee/biography/141 So, is the person bigger or the idea? I support both (and I can't digest the fact that people are sticking to the traditional corrupt, communal parties). AK is not extremely intelligent (and may say stupid things from time to time), but his heart is at right place and he did things consistent with the principles of AAP (except the Delhi house thingy, which is a minor infraction). AAP does not matter . Its the idea they bring that matters. 

THe IDEA is integrity , accountability and 0 tolerance to corruption.  

I see humility to accept their mistake publicly and change. 

I see their stand for the community. 

And I also see all the behind the door strategies to subdue them. 

India could be a golden bird again and people would line up to migrate to india rather that other way around THIS IDEA came into existence. 
 I loved the idea, the movement and the support. I joined rallies, shouted slogans and actually celebrated when they won Delhi.

Then congress happened. And then 49 days. 

Lost faith.  To be honest, i don't know what they stand for anymore. They messed up big time after forming the government in Delhi. Some of their decisions regarding power and water supply were good but the weird agitation and antics (of Somnath Bharti and few others) seemed like they were trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
Before the Delhi elections, my dad was invited to one of their meetings. He said most of the people there were former BJP and Congress members. I just think AAP and AK both are not mature enough to rule. I can be wrong, but this was my personal feeling while voting in 2014 Lok Sabha.  I imagine if anything removal of Kejriwal, Salim Yadav, Bhushan, Sisodia, Ashutosh etc. would be a bonus.

But seriously speaking, even with these faces gone, what exactly does AAP represent? Anti-corruption? Okay, but what are their policies. A repeated subject of criticism is that their members come from all idealogical backgrounds from left to right(or, from Medha Patkar to Meera Sanyal) and as a party they have very few clearly defined policies and viewpoints.

Also their frequent Muslim appeasement, sometimes going to ridiculous levels(eg. Holding concerts and candlelight vigils for Gaza when the public is more concerned with Saharanpur and other domestic issues) really gets on many voters' nerves. Similarly the fuss they made over Batla House and 'open letter to Muslims' last year was a turn-off for many voters. I'd be more willing to support them if the top 4 got removed. There are probably a lot of decent people who are working for AAP and they are ones who should be running the party, not attention whores like AK. ",53,0.74,1407095419.0

I see a few public toilets in the Mumbai Hyderabad high way within 2km stretch which was surprising. But it's not happening as fast as it should. The UPA had a similar Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan program, which was a failure.

Swachh Bharat, in all likelihood, is going the same way. Atleast to me, there is no visible outcome or change.

PS: Why do you have to keep justifying that you are not a hater, (not once but twice)? Ask your question boldly. If someone accuses you of something you are not, just ignore. No need to be this defensive that too upfront. What happened? 
People still blaming government for not doing thier job and continue to litter. 

One time, one of my uncle was driving me around in Delhi NCR. He was surprised to see that I kept my trash in my hand for hours until I found a trash can to throw it. When I asked the reason, he said I would have thrown it out from the window long time ago. He even told other people about it.

There are other updates too, just Google it. You are paying another tax now, that's what happened :) what else were you expecting :) In my town Belgaum Karnataka 

All pan shops have been given a dustbin to put outside their shop. 

Bus stand got cleaned. Railway station is clean. But the city is still dirty as usual. But I don't blame that on govt they clean dustbins and open dustbins daily. But a lot of opeople who still open gutka packet put it in mouth and throw the cover on the floor while standing next to a dustbin. They have also started a new drive for smokers they are giving metal pots for cigarette buds and told pan shops to enforce it some have some havnt Did you not see advertisements with Anupam Kher today? I don't have a clear idea about the cess. How does it work?

The funds from the cess go to Swacch Bharat Abhiyan; that much is clear.

So, how does a central government program seek to influence the efficiency of waste disposal and management at panchayat level and municipality level?

Is Swacch Bharat a cleanliness program or an awareness program about cleanliness? Swacch Bharat Cess is still there, I think. The campaigning is there no more, I think. Imho large ambitious culture changing government programs always fail. From 'big leap' to Jimmy Carter's attempt to reduce fossil fuel dependence they havr always always failed. 

Swachh Bharat can work as a branding exercise for several different infra improvement projects but I can't see how it will really bring any changes beyond that.  They are working not talking.  I don't know about anyone else, but where I live, this ""Swacch Bharat"" thing has failed miserably, completely.

The only thing that has been cleaned is the mayor's house, that retarded goon likes to litter his own place and then take photos of himself holding a mop. And then once his home is cleaned, the retard keeps claiming it as a remarkable achievement and first step to Swacch Bharat. Checking on this thread after 15 hours: the consensus seems that we should not litter. 
--
I still can't figure out the point of allocating crores when there's no unique problem solving for India's trash problem / our tendency to litter. more tax & seasonal topic for selfies/tweets.

Did you expect more than that ? Still people are loitering the spaces as before. Though Modi did a good job of bringing swacch bharat campaign he should have stopped the campaign with educating people to be clean and aware of cleanliness of their surroundings. Instead he started to impose swacch bharat cess which is not a good thing to do. Publicity should be given for swach bharat no doubt in that, but taxing people in name of swach bharat not good.

Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this, 

Can't one have a view which is contrarian to yours? Must everybody see the world only from your prism? Why needless ad-hominem? Everybody can indulge in it, but what would be the outcome? We would only be slinging insults at each other which mean nothing in real life and civil discourse is given the go by.

Once more onto the breech!!! but before I substantiate the claims I had made, some commonly repeated lines of reasoning need to be rebutted.

**Israel is surrounded by enemies & it's very survival is in question, so it has the right to do whatever it feels like doing**

* This was true in 47, this was true in 67 (which is where the seeds of the current conflicts were sown), but it is absolutely not true in 2014 (or not for the past 25-30 years at the least).

* It's major opposition has been completely neutralised - Egypt? It has a peace accord which both have respected, likewise Jordan, Iraq is out of the equation, Iran's nuclear plans have been neutralised and while on paper it remains a credible threat, the reality is that the whole world knows, if Iran even makes a hint of a hostile move in this region against any country, let alone Israel, it will feel the full impact of the US military (and maybe NATO as a whole)...so Iran is clearly not a threat. That leaves us states like Lebanon (which has it's own problems, largely caused by Israeli policies, and has shown that left to it's own tends to gravitate towards a fairly tolerant model).

* In terms of defence budgets, in terms of quality of manpower, training, equipment (all Uncle Sam's blessings mostly) the IDF is far and away miles ahead of it's closest competitors, so this whole ""Israel under siege"" nonsense needs to be put to rest.

**Israel is this utopia for Israeli Arabs**

* At the outset, one cannot but be blind to the fact that Israeli arabs have far more rights in Israel than in any other major Islamic country, only a fool will deny it, but it still has some serious questions raised on how Israeli arabs are treated as second class citizens with serious cries of even an almost apartheid like state in many areas and there are moves to constitutionalise this in the form of the [Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_proposal:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People), [some more on this](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/04/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-jewish-state).

Historically this goes against what it's founder David Ben Gurion wanted - he wanted (and had his way when the constitution of Israel was framed) Arabs to be treated equally, and no discrimination at all to be practiced. At the time Israel was formed, he went all out to assure Arabs that they will be treated well in Israel and requested Arab's to stay back in their villages and homes. Now in a classic case of fear mongering (similar to the one in India), Muslim leaders warned of a genocide of Arab's & Muslims and succeeded in winning over their people and thus began a massive exodus.

This hawkish stance of Israel in recent times is what I as an observer of that region deride - if when truly surrounded by enemies, Israel could afford to be magnanimous, what is the need now to disenfranchise Arabs? How different (in spirit if not in actual themes) is this different from the [Nuremberg laws?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws)

How can, *Arabs are second class citizens in Israel, but are better off than in other Arab countries ever be an excuse for this discrimination*? Is Tu quoque ever a solution? When a country like Israel with it's history of treating Muslims, Arabs well (Israeli) over time becomes exceedingly hawkish and discriminatory, does it not require wide condemnation? 


Now, to address the points I had made.

**Israel consistently violates agreement's it has signed or agreed to sign in negotiations with the PLO / Palestinian Arabs**

A couple of Wiki links on stuff like this alone will not suffice, they barely even scratch the surface of the reality that is Israel's duplicituous and perfidious stance when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians.

Let me as an example address Madrid. /u/pbdirigible says no agreement was signed in Madrid as that is what Wiki will tell you.

Reality went like this,

* As a precondition to Madrid, Israel wanted a UN resolution - resolution # 3379 struck off it's books (revoked), the US and the Arabs agreed to this and it was done.

* Yizhtak Shamir then wanted an unconditional loan guarantee of $ 10 billion from the US (which was later given without any fuss to the next Israeli regime to form the government), but the Bush proposal of wanting specific guarantees from Israel on troop reduction from the occupied territories was outright rejected. Bush stood firm on this, and Shamir had to back down.

* Then came the new effort at stalling the process - Shamir and Israel outright rejected PLO negotiators (though PLO was as per the previous resolution 3379 granted observer status and was the defacto political entity representing the Palestinians), he got his way.

* Then Israel played it's final trump card - Madrid won't see any Israeli negotiation, but it will broadly agree on the items to be negotiated (troop withdrawals, and Israeli withdrawal from the illegally occupied territories). These two items had been a condition of the ceasefire after the Yom Kippur war - [Resolution 242](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242) and [Resolution 338](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242), the Palestinians (secretly operating on behalf of the PLO) agreed. By this time Shamir had lost the elections (he was seen as too hawkish even by the Israeli's) and Rabin had come to power - he said **Israel WILL HONOUR it's commitments, and slowly start phased troop withdrawals and got the $ 10 BN loan**...and then promptly Israel went back on it's words. It did hold 5 other parleys, in which they stalled the entire process (Palestinian demands were simple, do what Israel has repeatedly promised to do) till it collapsed without anything emerging from it.

This level of duplicity was then seen in Oslo, to go into that at length would mean too much of a digression, but suffice to say that Israel played the same game of making promises (This time in an accord, so no disputing it) and then promptly going back on them. From the previous parleys and UN resolutions, Israel forced Arafat to something called three tier zones - in which Palestinian self governance was recognised ONLY in Zone A which was a very truncated area, this buried all Israeli promises, UN resolutions, Security council resolutions finally - of course, now, they are encroaching onto even zone A.

I will keep adding to this post as it is taking me time to draft these. I hope that my rabid right winger bretheren cool down on the ad-hominem, don't call me a pot smoking hippie who pulls stuff from his arse and respond with facts, figures and opinions formed out of those.

Interestingly enough, I was also a hard core Israel supporter till 5-6 years ago, when a lot of reading from the Palestinian perspective gave me a whole lot to think about.

Some must read to get a balanced perspective (if you are interested in a balanced perspective that is)

* [The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk](http://www.amazon.in/The-Great-War-Civilisation-Conquest/dp/1400075173) - This is a MUST READ for anybody interested in understanding the politics in the Middle East

* [Lords of the Land](http://www.amazon.in/Lords-Land-Settlements-Occupied-Territories/dp/1568584148/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400410129&sr=1-1&keywords=Lords+of+the+Land%3A+The+War+Over+Israel%27s+Settlements+in+the+Occupied+..) - the paperback is atrociously expensive, but most uni libraries stock it, or the Kindle version is only Rs 500 or so.

* The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History by Ian Bickerton - provides some solid insight into the roots of the conflict. I paired this with some fictional work by Leon Uris, gave me a good flavour for the period.

* Fictional works by Leon Uris (just for the flavour, he does some solid research)

* Israel the West Bank and International Law - The definitive work on the legal aspects (various UN resolutions, the whole legality of the Israeli occupation etc), a little dry, but interesting if you can break through the whole dry style.

Note - I have referenced Wiki as a starting point, but my main citations would be from the books I have referred, though please don't expect me to start quoting page numbers - I am not quoting directly from these (and other books I have not mentioned here), but my ideas and opinions were framed by these.

Is this a conscious attempt to show your liberal side? I am not disparaging dissent, just asking if this was written self-consciously? >Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren

:)

It might be a sweeping generalisation, but in my opinion, the right wing support for Israel is only because of the fact that the oppressed people are Muslims. If they were Hindus, the situation would have been completely different. 

I fail to see how a state which routinely razes down Palestinian homes and has brazenly driven out people from their own country can be considered anything but inhumane.  [deleted] One of the major issues with understanding the actions of the israeli gov't is that people try to make a general sense of the conflict and sometimes even try to find patterns in the rhetorics used by both sides.

The sad truth is that in the middle east trying to generalize and find patterns doesnt work. israelis and arabs from in and around the region (and im talking specifically about the [Mashriq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashriq) region)
are divided in most cases. arabs who live in ramallah come from different hamula(family) then arabs who live in jenin or jericho and some cities are basically shared by 2-3 families that have conflict with other families from other cities and using assault rifles to solve those conflict is pretty common.

most arab villages have 1-2 families in them and in some cases they wont even let their girls marry with people from other villages.

Different arab families immigrated to israel in different times and their social and financial status reflect that.

israelis are divided by countries of origin and the year they immigrated to israel. jewish-israeli citizens who experience the tensions can even spot them in political decisions and economic trends.

Those issues make it almost impossible to have an unbiased academic research on culture or history within the region.
the amount of information you need to understand the region is too big and without living in israel and experiencing day to day life in different parts of israel i dont see how anyone could understand whats happening here.

 >Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this

 
That's because a good part of all deeply anti-Zionist people are most of those things. Not all of them, not even the majority, but a good non-token part of them, they are antisemites embarrassed of their antisemitism using zionists as their to-go word for everything wrong in the world. Same thing with everything else, basically, nowadays being a racist is not ""cool""  so people hide their racism in ways that are socially acceptable (misogynists don't hate women anymore, they hate feminists; xenophobes don't hate brown people anymore, they hate Islam, and so on. Not all the people who hate feminists and Islam are misogynists or xenophobes, but a good part of them are). 

You, on the other hand, seem like a smart person who simply but respectfully disagrees with me and my worldview. Which is why I upvoted you, even if I'm one of the most right-wing Israelis on reddit as a whole; good debate can and should be had, but good debate is not spamming a YouTube video of definitive proof of a Rothschild Zionist conspiracy to control the world. 

Or to give you another example, somebody like yourself would be very welcome to post in r/Israel and debate about whatever you want, as you are a rational person with a different mindview. Somebody like this person http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25rnou/israels_prime_minister_netanyahu_congratulates/chk7jhf would not be, as he is most certainly an antisemitic asshole hiding behind good old Zionism to post his shit.  > receiving end of my right wing brethren..Please point me to the specific thread. I'd like to know about what the views of this ""right wing brethren"" are. 1. You referenced ""Israel's Constitution"".  In fact, Israel does not have a constitution.

2. Why did Arafat walk away from the Clinton Parameters in 2000-01?  Read what Bill Clinton wrote on the subject.

3. Without Palestinian recognition of Israel, as a Jewish State, in whatever borders are agreed to, the conflict will not truly be over.  Only an agreement that ends all present and future claims on both sides will be worth the paper it is written on.

4. Discrimination--it exists in Israel and in many other places, and is extensive in India. So long as Israel and the Palestinians are in a state of conflict, you should not be surprised that it exists.  To compare it to the Nuremberg Laws indicates you may not know too much about them.  Sorry if I am being honest.  Bear in mind, as well, the rhetoric about Jews and Israel used in Palestinian media?  Also, did it ever occur to you to ask the Palestinians what they want and are willing to accept?    You might find that it is not at all what you ASSUME they would agree to.  

BTW, have you ever had a look at the PEW global attitudes survey?  

Full disclosure--I support the Clinton Parameters and the likely Kerry Plan, and don't at all like the current Netanyahu regime.  I also think if an agreement based on the Clinton Parameters is not possible, Israel should unilaterally withdraw to the security wall.  I agree, mostly, with the basic spirit of what you write and am sure you are well meaning. I can only suggest you think more about what the Palestinians really want and are willing to accept, not what you imagine they want and also, whether the current situation is not a consequence of the failure of the Camp David/Clinton Parameters talks?    
 Don't know much about the subject,  except that I like Israel,  and I support it's political decisions

Depending on the technology the max amount of bandwidth available for ""Public use"" is a fixed amount. Let's for sake of discussion, equate Bandwidth = Money. India has already shown that Socialism is a failed concept. i.e equal money to all is foolishness and gives rise to corruption and is basically, a disaster  that would take years to be recovered from. So why would it be better in case of internet? Wouldn't it be much better if more bandwidth is allocated to services that is necessary for public rather than services that are entertainment for public. Like say, wouldn't it be more beneficial if more bandwidth is provided for Hospitals, Defense, Emergency services etc, rather than say, Netflix or porn sites? Lets talk about future, suppose a service like Netflix is started in India, which becomes so famous, that almost, 50-60% of population is on Netflix on sunday, using more than 50-60% of total bandwidth available with that technology, wouldn't it decrease the bandwidth of an emergency service, or Hospital, or research lab, or defense services.

- they expect news anchors to remain mum when their party members justify terrorism,

- they expect us to believe that only others are communal, but they, the most communal of all are ""self appointed"" certificate authority of the secularism in the country

Edit: 
Just for [comparison sake](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-01/mumbai/37372247_1_ac-restaurants-service-tax-restaurant-owner) the service tax (luxury tax) is approximately 5% of the entire bill. In a country like India with not-very-great tipping culture, even the tip to a working class waiter will be less than 5% of the bill amount. But, approximately 5% of the entire food bill goes to the coffers of a corrupt government who will eventually end up making a multi-crore scam out of it and make the money vanish instead of using it for public good.  This was a harmless expression of social protest. He wasn't hurting anyone high up in the Congress, no thousands of people were queuing up and chanting slogans here, not even another political party was interested in what was happening here.

It's a really sad day that Congress felt the need to go and snuff this out. The insecurity, the arrogance ... its mindboggling. The guy so calmly said that this was all done by non-legal channels and he should express himself through legal ways, WHILE using his political clout to get his shop closed. Over a goddamn two line statement at the end of a fucking bill. >Youth Congress leaders expressed surprise that **despite all the work they put in for the greater good of the people, some failed to notice it.** “We are doing such good work in our areas as part of the Youth Congress and such comments de-motivate people from joining the party.

Let me just leave this news article about the NSUI Mumbai wing president from last month :

http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1831516/report-nsui-mumbai-president-suraj-thakur-suspended-for-dirty-dancing This reminds me of an incident in the 80s. A ""talent show"" on All India Radio was hosting some children, and the host asked a child to recite a poem. The child went ""Gali Gali me shor hai, Rajiv Gandhi chor hai"" (Roughly translated, every one knows, Rajiv Gandhi is a thief).

Congress workers beat up the host, and had him fired from his job. Didnt save Rajiv's govt in the next elections though. Fuck, Never in a million years would  I have thought my post in reddit would have such undesirable consequences. I guess I have to blur out the name of a person or institution who insults congress next time I post.  NUSI goons are worse the VHP goons.

EDIT - How in the bloody hell is this defamation??  >The owner might have his issues but he should fight them in a legal way rather than defaming the party for some people’s corruption,” said Sandeep Pansade, general secretary, south-central region of Youth Congress.

Commentaries were being passed, editorials were being written, TV-debates were being organized ,verdicts were being passed -- all in all the outrage industry was in full flow..

Now **Congress goons**, **IN REAL LIFE**, force a restaurant to be shut down because the hotel had the gumption to print certain **bitter truths** in their bill footer. The livelihoods of many people have been directly affected. Now will the outrage industry please put up its hands ? 

I guess not. Because as loyal dogs, you are expected to bark only when the master tells you to. Congress the haat aam aadmi ke saath.

http://www.infosys.com/finacle/solutions/thought-papers/Documents/why-India-needs-islamic-banking.pdf


Here is why we actually need it:

1.  Interest free loans to all, No bank fees
2.  Could ethically be appealing to the Poorest Sections of India -         Muslim

These may also lead to communal violence  which makes me wonder that if these banks will be target if there are problems in the city. ",34," From all that I have read about the implementation, there is no functional difference except for terminology by calling interest as profit. 

Edit:

The infosys report cites twocircles.net as a reference. Also here is a report, [Islamic Banking is a Myth](http://www.dawn.com/news/881273/islamic-banking-is-a-mere-myth) on it from Dawn.
Also this by the tribune, [Is Islamic banking as exploitative as conventional banking?](http://tribune.com.pk/story/538577/is-islamic-banking-as-exploitative-as-conventional-banking/). Pakistan has these banks already that is why I am citing their papers. Though i don't support it. There is already one Muslim bank. It runs with support of Hdfc bank. People have a large misconception about Islamic Banking. This is due to the fact that everybody tries to provide opinions without understanding what Islamic Banking is. 

No, it does not provide any advantage to Muslims. All it does is provide a loophole to muslims because interests are forbidden in Islam.

Let me give a small example of how it works.

Say, you are buying a car for 6 Lakhs and you decide to take a normal loan. He might put around 15% interest rate over 4 years and the EMI would come to around 15,000 per month. You end up paying 8 lakhs over the course of 4 years. In this case, you are buying the car directly from the dealer.

Now, in Islamic Banking, you don't buy the car directly from the dealer but through the bank. What this means is that the bank buys the car from the dealer and then sell it to you. The banks doesn't sell you the car for 6 lakhs but they would sell it to you for a higher, fixed amount - say 8 lakhs. This 8 lakhs would be split into monthly installment. So, in effect you are not paying any interest technically. 

Both normal banking and islamic banking would more or less cost the same to the customer. It just makes the process legal under Islam How do they make profit?, to the OP: would encourage you to not shout or whisper about your caste .... the sooner we get rid of our caste tags (branded on us by birth) the better the country will progress !   

how does it sound if you declare yourself as ""caste-less"" ?   <apologies for deviating from the topic !> Yes, interest free loans are sure to help keep inflation down. (sic)

I think most of the users here were first into digg. The same bury culture is in vogue here. uh guy, we dont need you lecturing us on fancy rules. am indian. there are no rules. just hazy guidelines and such. but we know better. We are Indian. We don't like rules. Why, cause that's hip and happening. We want to portray ourselves as advanced, intelligent beings who have invented things long before these European jokers, who have risen up from their sub-human medieval barbaric lives only in the past 200 or so years, while Indian civilization goes back to time immemorial. We don't take instructions from these neophytes, we define what we do and what is good for us and we do it (sorry, there is no such thing as ""define"" as we don't believe in such things as definitions and rules as they are ""rules"" and hence intrinsically binding and restrictive). We believe we had already invented, eons ago, all things that modern science purports to have recently discovered, thus proving our superiority, hence we do not have to answer to anyone or to bow to discipline. In the new age, there are no rules, other than what we define. We have long ago discovered the universal, all encompassing nature of the individual, and we don't like having restrictions of objectivity and discipline being thrust on us. Places like reddit are where we can be truly free and display our love for openness (and tolerance) and our disdain for puritanical, archaic and dogmatic philosophies like following rules (yuck!) set by someone else, as it lowers our dignity and rights as free thinkers and innovators in this modern world.

Don't ask us to follow rules, we will down-vote you into oblivion if you do! No one follows the reddiquette to the core over here. Earlier downvoting was a curse when we didn't have the sub-reddits.

As I have bias towards him, would love to read why his detractors feel that way.

That being said, aren't all of India's politicians solo leaders who brook ZERO intra party dissension? At least Modi had to fight his own party to stake the claim of first among equals, whereas people like a Sonia, Rahul or Jaya or Mulayam are uncontested leaders of their parties.

Take the rise of Sonia, she quelled all dissent, ruthlessly shut down eminent people like Narashima Rao, chose to operate the PM via remote control, thereby denigrating the role of the PM as the head of state who constitutionally has only the President above him, has her ""eyes & ears"" in all aspects of governance, who has despite holding all the reins of power been a reculse and has given maybe 2,3 interviews at best in 10 years. Whose son has the gumption to tear up a Cabinet ordinance and proclaim it as nonsense...how is any of this not fascist or dictatorial?

We need not even go down to the regional parties where people like Mulayam, Maya or Jaya lord it up like kings & queens.

Modi on the other hand, has had to fight his claim to be CM of Guj, has had to fight his way to be the face of the BJP, he still has his powerful detractors within the BJP. He has despite his detractors saying otherwise, given many many interviews over the past 10 odd years, and who has no family that will follow his footsteps as though it is some divine right.

I truly would like to understand why he is feared as being a potential despot.",7," The truth of the matter seems to be that many people cannot get over 2002 and the BJP's communal reputation. However that is seen as a tired, redundant argument today so they instead attack the BJP on everything else that other parties and leaders are usually given a pass on.

That is the impression I have gotten. The Congress is run by a single family and most of the regional parties are run by 1-2 prominent leaders, yet it is only Modi's dictatorial style that is focused on by critics. Most parties in UP had some involvement in Muzzafarnagar riots but the BJP is singled out. And so on. Which of the accusation made on Modi,let alone being a dictator is logical? They (haters) want to belittle him one way or other by calling him divisive,polariser,fundamentalist and whatnot.As if their opinions matter to him.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

92,bdfid1,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,AskIndia,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",27," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",17," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

97,a2nsgt,What is 'Gotra'?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,AskIndia,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",33," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  
>

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

99,bemcxg,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,AskIndia,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",24," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",52,0.9,1555627392.0
100,968di3,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,AskIndia,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",67," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*",50," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself.",8,0.59,1491423897.0

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

103,6bacbg,We really need to talk about Flairs.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,AskIndia,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",133," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",108,0.91,1494883276.0
104,4qepvz,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,AskIndia,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",14," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there.

We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.
*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result. Thanks to all for your suggestions, it really means a lot :)",42," Are you good looking and bald ?

This is more than enough. 

And don't worry about bald. Work with what you've got. Make that work for you. 
And as /u/immediate_cock mentioned, Lift, Lift and Lift more. i think you are not asking the right question to right people. i mean i doubt sehwag sir is a member here ?

i mean you have clearly demonstrated you are  person of means. quietly go for what sehwag sir did and regrow the silky smooth hairs on your balding patch. ( find a way to excuse yourselves from your GF )


BTW nobody knows what your girl thinks? maybe she is not really into your appearance only and may come to terms upon new knowledge about your balding head. 

so there are two ways given above. sehwag sir ki clinic ka address twitter DM me poochna, aajkal wo baato ke chakke marne me champion hai.  [deleted] > I am hopelessly in love with a girl  
    
No, you're not.  Balding like a girl? Is that in anyway different from balding like a guy? /s Tell her but don't take it to your head, you know, whatever she says. She's just another girl. Also the hair on your head has little to do with attractiveness. And you'll get over the ""feeling"".  

Cliched line, but since you are afraid of her rejection: Be a man.
 ""Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you""Matthew 7:7 what does settled for life mean?  >in a secure job

Theres nothing of the sort in the pvt sector. Are you in a govt job?  Go Heisenberg style.  Dude you sound defeated , chicks dig confidence . Shave your head , hit the gym and watch the panties drop . Your mileage may wary, I started balding in early 20s , shaved my head and had an active dating life . Now mid 30s , happily married . Confidence is the key not some filmi love  Saar, pliss to give me her number so that I can talk to her since you don't seem to be very interested. Talk to her for fucks sake or forget her. Worst thing you can do is hold on to her and waste precious time You're probably screwed. It hurts worse than anything, I know ;) 

- Alt a) If you got the stomach for it: Clean cut. Don't have her in your life. You'll miss her and it will hurt for a while. But the pain numbs after about 6 months, soon you'll move on. 

- Alt b) Remember: we most regret chances we never took. You say she knows you like her. Well, then you making a move will not surprise her; she might even like it (small chance). Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled. Have you ever thought about the millions in this country who do not even have a proper meal everyday and are forced to sleep in open in this cold weather? I suppose not.

I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!",4," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",11," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc.",5,0.79,1535320431.0

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",33," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.

118,3huilc,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,AskIndia,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]
* Sports: [SP]
* Technology: [TECH],[TE]
* Food: [FO], [Food]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political]
* Politics: [P], [Politics]",98," You guys are increasing your own work and in a couple of days you won't be able to do what you started and then selectively apply rules. Happens every time you still don't learn.  I'm confused.

> * **Link submissions** that refer non-personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a **self-post**

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion?

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

 LOL news of the day. I considered python to be most useful language for scientific research. in b4 'we invant' True. Just like Urdu is important for space travel. 
/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim? [deleted] OMG, what a chutiya ?  I charge my mobile using ""Sanskrit'. Wish he had usefully made his speech in Sanskrit; with all reporting in Sanskrit. Then we could ignore him more. [deleted] Scientific Method most useful for science, technology, actual scientists say. 

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

> * Be it art, literature, science or technology, people are admitting Sanskrit is most useful,"" Singh said addressing the launch of a ""Mahaabhiyan"" to take Sanskrit to every house which is being led by an educational institution here.He said that even Nasa, while building a super computer, had said that Sanskrit was the most suitable language for it.

> * ""But the irony is that we are getting away from it in India,"" he said.Singh said that Sanskrit does not have a problem of spelling like other languages, such as English, and was pronounced in a similar manner everywhere.

> * Unlike other languages, where pronunciation varies from region to region, Sanskrit does not have this problem as it is based on sound science, he added.

> * ""Even youths in the US and UK are reading Sanskrit,"" he said.Singh said that as during his stint as the education minister in Uttar Pradesh government, he had introduced two chapters on Vedic mathematics in the school curriculum which, however, were later removed by the subsequent governments.He said that if there was the will, knowledge of Sanskrit could be taken to each and every house.

Respect! Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!! Because a more precise language like German is so much more popular and used worldwide in science and technology than a less precise one like english

  My first language is Sanskrit, it did help me a LOT to easily learn other Indian languages. But this is blind pandering. If only he knew Sanskrit is a Indo-European language and its getting impractical due to its lack of adaptation to modern terminologies.

  Just wasting tax money on futile efforts of promoting on one language, building expensive statues etc . First feed the hungry farmers and 1/3rd of world's poor in India.

 These leaders have their children educated in Oxford and Cambridge, but want Indians to waste time to please these guys vote bank.

   Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

126,918ek7,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,Science/Technology,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",3," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. ",6,0.76,1532391253.0

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

Please help me by answering a short survey here: [http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U](http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U).

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)",35," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year.

132,bwmz0o,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,Science/Technology,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

133,bpgagr,To Redditors of Kolkata,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,Science/Technology,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",0,,1,0.67,1558060692.0
134,6w8oqs,"India is not a country, it is a union of countries",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6w8oqs/india_is_not_a_country_it_is_a_union_of_countries/,Science/Technology,"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it’s true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. 

Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we’re supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they’re to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. 

So why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‘nationalism’ while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it’s people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it’s worse than physically crippling one. 

When we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. 

Democracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. 

I’m no anti-national. National and anti-national don’t even mean anything if one digs deeper. They’re simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‘national’ or ‘anti-national’. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don’t care, they don’t even know, they will say anything to get media’s attention and media’s attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‘nation’. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology. ",44," A country is not a country .....its a union of states.

A state is not a state....its a union of divisions.

A division is not a division.....its a union of districts.

A district is not a district.....its a union of mohallas.

A mohalla is not a mohalla.....its a union of families.

A family is not a family....its a union of individuals.

Whats the point ?? Pigs everywhere !!!! You sound pretty salty here. Let's clarify some things:

1. There are nations that form for different reasons. India formed because of the of a) The British (at least in terms of their empire) and b) The Indian Freedom Fighters (who tried to keep the country consolidated after independence. Kudos particularly to Vallabhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/S8YxVMKFfwaIeLHUWCYINI/Vallabhbhai-Patel-and-the-making-of-India.html)

1. Second, their rationale behind them was not to ""Collect Taxes"". Contrary to what you're saying, the fathers of our nation believed that we were better and stronger together. Patel, Nehru, Gandhi, Ambedkar, Naidu, et. al. believed keeping the Indian state intact was the natural thing to do. They had a relatively cosmopolitan education/upbringing and believed people of all states needed to band together. Their regional affiliations didn't necessarily bleed onto their mission.

1. While I agree there's a lot of graft and corruption in the Indian Bureaucracy and Political System, India has done well since independence, particularly in the last two decades. How can I say this? Well, GDP per capita has risen from $1100 in 1990 to $6570 in 2016. Here's the source: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=IN

1. You mention India has a Billion people (1.324 Billion) and then complain about education for everyone. You do realize that's a LOT of people right. It'll take decades for primary education to reach them all. Some states are doing it better than others (Kerala for example). It just requires political will.

1. You talk about our GDP numbers like they're a smokescreen. It's not. India is one of the largest economies in the world and while our GDP per capita isn't equal to that of western nations and other Asian countries, it also means we have tremendous potential for growth. Something other countries are struggling with. I hate people comparing us with the US and other European countries. We're literally one of the youngest countries in the world! How well do you think the US was doing in 1860?

1. Democracy is supposed to mean every person has a single vote. It has its flaws, but it is the fairest form of governance. At the end of the day, an imperfect system is better than an oppressive one. And give Indians the credit they deserve. Modi was voted in to bring economic reform. People voted for him because they wanted better lives for their kids. Vote bank politics is dying, slowly but surely. 


Finally, I'd like to say, I know your intentions are very noble here. But it's easy to sit back and complain and bitch about the country. It's harder to roll up your sleeves and work for the nation. I'm not saying you don't do that, but r/india is a great resource to discuss this. There are many educated and diverse opinions here. Eventually, the unkills will leave the country behind for us. Let's not become like them and die saying Sare Jahan se accha Hindustan hamara and then having their kids move abroad.  Add a TLDR please..and I don't know what you are trying to get at.. and how you arrived on answer of union of states, from tax. 

Eating tax of a billion people.?? Which tax are we talking about? The number income tax payers is < 3 %

 >Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation.

This nationalism is a very modern concept. We been cosmopolitan from early ages itself. And cherished the subcontinent or peninsula more like a single entity of similar culture. 

For example Sankaracharya from extreme south established four temples at the four corners of modern India at an ancient time where nationalism wasn't upfront. Ujjain has remained the astronomical center for many of Indian calenders, irrespective of kingdoms. 

There is a reason for our extreme population, the land has been sought out by people from all over for fertile pastures and wealth, and those who came here settled. And diversity was inherent of land that shaped its culture, unlike other countries where ethnic groups clustered together. While in America every differences get melted into single stream, here people welcomed the diversity, and it still says that way. 

Also if European population hasn't moved out to their colonies, they would have been faced with this population problem as ours, am sure. > Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans

Nope. Sinhala people are Indo Aryan. They are more closer to Bengalis and Biharis than Tamilians. Your argument is trying to make India out to be a special snowflake.

Just look up the history of the **US of A** or **Germany.**

India's circumstances are not unique or new. These guys will give you the same old bullshit man that's the problem. Fuckers will still tell you about mother india being rich and wealthy centuries ago. We gave the world zero blah blah fucking blah. India is tragic as fuck, the talent and the potential is out of this world but the majority of the people are absolute fucking filth when it comes to mentality. Materialistic, show off, jealous, blinded by religion. Anything for the rupee, will literally sell their own mothers for money. They consider the ability to have maids and slaves as a fucking wow factor of living in India in 2017........all the butthurts are going to down vote this to death. 2 or 3 percent of people won't be like this. Biggest tragedy was the goras leaving. But OP is right though.....no unity at all. Which is one reason I love watching the Indian cricket team at least I feel like there is some unity, that and probably the defense forces. General public bheinchod tamasha dekhne ke liye paida hui hai. Bollywood, Ekta Kapoor, Politics, Babas.....so much chutiyappa. What you basically want is a federal structure, and you'd be surprised to know that the concepts of federalism is already there in the constitution. There are topics which are the state govt's prerogative and the central govt. can't interfere, and there are topics where the opposite is true. It's the reason why we have state governments at all in addition to having central governments. Federalism is something our founding fathers believed in, all it needs is to be strengthened and properly observed. I don't think your idea of completely splitting the country apart into smaller nations is viable. If nothing else, surely you believe that having a single unified military and financial structure is more beneficial than having dozens of them?

>A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy.

The point of democracy is that every citizen has an equal vote share by the virtue of being a citizen, not by the virtue of how productive they are or how educated. If you spend a few minutes pondering on what you wrote, you'd realize how unfair your proposed system would be and how quickly it'll lead to tyranny, by a group if not by an individual.

>When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power.

Which is still better than not caring about votes at all and just shoving a gun at people's faces and telling them to do this and that. Again, while nobody says democracy is perfect, you'd realize it's still better than all the alternatives. Enlightened dictatorships only happen in fictions. This feels like a bad idea. Our ""confideracy"" of states will get chewed out by China. Besides.. being part of the same country is beneficial. Look at the water disputed between Karnataka and TN. Things would be a lot worse.

135,7yz12m,Need help with depression and anger.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,Science/Technology,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",3," Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now.

Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.

137,4gbzmf,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,Science/Technology,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

",18," So it's basically a fridge. >and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

We could also get married and I could apply for an X-visa, and whilst marriage is on the cards, and eventually I will apply for an OCI card, the X-visa doesn't let you work, and so short-term isn't much use above letting me stay there whilst I look for work.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.
",52," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front.

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",1," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.",1,0.55,1403105851.0

\> The IISc team observed that at a critical temperature of 160 K (-113.15 degree C) and critical current of little less than 10 milliampere the voltage suddenly shoots up and the gold-silver nanostructures no longer exhibit superconductivity as resistance increases rapidly. A superconductor is one which conducts electricity with zero resistance to the flow of electrons. 

and 

\> Clarifying about the zero voltage Prof. Ghosh said, “At temperatures slightly below 161.3 K the voltage is zero up to 10 milliampere current. The voltage may increase at higher current, which was not tested. Similar behaviour was observed in metal whiskers where superconductivity is observed at a lower temperature. If this is true, why the hell are we publicizing the research??

This would be a journal of BJP stupidity in printed forget, See, people who are dumb, lazy, without an iota of critical thinking, comepletely superstitious, are very easy to subdue and control. You can guess what their endgame is. What's the end game?

Is this just another jumla to win more elections?

Don't they want to actually run the country for about 20-30 years?

Are they all one day going to get up and scoot to Antigua, Nigeria and UK?

Ambani cannot run away like Choksi or Modi did.

Nor can the Sangh.

Can't they see that the first chance that China sees of a broken country, they will try to control the country?

What's the 20 year game plan of Shah?

Winning elections is cool and I respect their awesome skills at manipulating everybody and everything without hacking EVMs, but in the end, where is this headed?

A feudal India is just waiting to be colonised or defeated economically to the point of virtual colonisation like China is doing with African and some Central and West Asian nations. USA is on the decline. China isn't going to stop till it becomes _the_ biggest superpower.

Modi can't see how he is dismantling the country because he is a psycopath who has achieved his life goal and is rudderless. He already has become King Emperor. There's nothing left to do.

But what's with the Sangh and Shah?

The Sangh plans well, like an expert Sith Lord waiting for decades.

I don't see an endgame here that benefits them - unless they really truly believe in a 1800s or 1700s culture as being the best for India. Then we are truly in the grip of a mad cult.

But I doubt that. Ambani, of all people, has serious vision. Will he step in and become PM? If not openly, by proxy?

Doesn't he have a vision for a billion and half potential slaves?

He has to understand economics really well, right?

Disposable incomes and all that.

What's the Sangh's endgame?

With Congress / UPA you could see that the endgame is simple - stay in power, do 20% good, 30% bad and 50% negligence - and just always stay in power. That 20% good was RTI and stable economy and all that.

With this Govt, there is literally no real 20% good.

There's only madness of one kind or another - cow, Mandir, vedic supremacy, ""China is bad"" while everything patriotic is owned by or made in China, Swachch Bharat is a joke, DeMo was a scam, GST is a disaster, Aadhar is a conspiracy.

Kuch to long term socha bhi hai ki nahi?

I can forgive Modi being a fool. He is a megalomaniac. But I cannot digest that all of them are fools and nobody is asking them to look at the bigger picture or the longer term.

They're behaving like day traders when they own the stock exchange. 

Who does that level of stupidity?

They are the house and they are gambling as if they need to win desperately. What gives?

Are they sure that they will not win more than once?

Is this all a 10 year con with their full knowledge that they cannot get a 3rd term?

If this is a 10 year con, which country are they going to flee to?

I just don't get it.

In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

Edit: Spelling",42," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen.

3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.
Giving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.

Irony.

Situation will only get worse. Don't worry. > The liquidity crunch has become tighter because it’s no longer as easy to do business. AIM Nonwovens sought refunds of Rs21 lakh for the Goods & Services Tax...

This bit boils my blood. The tax you have to pay is due immediately, but your input claims are never accepted on time, especially if it is a large amount. Idk if this idea is dumb but i think our cultural economy has so much potential and it's obviously being under utilised.

156,c95ykl,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,Policy/Economy,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",46," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they’re busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it’s some weird waste of time in the “you aren’t even wrong” kind of bad.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

>In articles published in The Times of India and Livemint titled, ""Will Black Be Back? Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India’s fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China?

His academic views of the financial system was in contrast with the rest of the system. 

Bichde sabhi baari baari... BC hope there's no announcement coming that he wants to disown. This was bound to happen. Oh this is bad. Very very bad.

Deputy governor is a very important member of the Monetary Policy Committee ( one that decides policy stance and repo rates, basically major macroeconomic decisions ). This 5 member panel has government nominees too and decisions are taken by majority vote. 

Since the decisions are taken by a majority vote, it is always advisable to have majority economists so that RBI policies are not driven by political agendas but only sound economics.

And he was one of the few economists in the panel that constitute the MPC, especially after they replaced an economist with a Bureaucrat as the governor RBI.

So why would he quit? Essentially because there's no point for him to be there as virtual liquidation of RBI as an institution has lead to loss of value of individual opinion. In an organisation dominated by bureaucrats, decisions are now not taken in Mumbai ( RBI HQ ) but in Delhi. 

Terrible news. The off balance sheet borrowing pegs the fiscal deficit at 8-9% of the GDP.

So much easier to pass reforms in dictatorship than in a democracy where people care about their political party and winning elections more than they care for the country. Let's stop this silly comparison to China. The beat us badly in the last 1-2 decades, and we are not going to catch up with them now. I am not sure how many commenting have actually read the article,  headline is misleading and does not tell what is the comparison,  bloomberg talks of defense budget mainly, in what sense can india compete with china's defense budget, china is a much bigger economy and have more spending power and is not comparable to india Because economic growth is exponential. The increase in the size of the economy depends on the current size of the economy. China's economy is already 5 times ours. Military spending and geo-political influence which the article is talking about depend on the current size of the economy. It is mathematically impossible for India to 'catch up' with China unless China's economic growth slips to around 2%. Has more to do with China performing exceptionally well than India underperforming.

India is the fastest growing major economy right now but will never reach the crazy per year growth China has had. Mitron....china ki growth kya hai bus ek waham hai Catapult ko bhi peeche Kheecha hota hai bhaiyya🤣 defense spending is not a good way to measure anything, we need to see educational and health spend Hey I don't think that is the case though. If you only read the media you think India is incredibly corrupted and all the streets have trash on them. In reality some areas are quite prosperous, clean, and modern.

As in, what kinds of domestic policy and foreign policy do you think that a united India (one that keeps Pakistan and Bangladesh) would have had and also how would its economy, economic development, industrialization, and business climate compare to that of India in real life?",6," An undivided India would've been a disaster which would have made Indians pine for the rule of the British. The compromises that the Congress and the Muslim league would have had to make to avoid partition would've led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces, this would've quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in India with the Muslim provinces of Kashmir, sind, eastern Bengal, Punjab (barely Muslim majority though),NWFP facing off against the Hindu provinces elsewhere.

There would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you can't even imagine. The Muslim league during British times often petitioned them to declare Sind and NWFP as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the Hindu dominated provinces of present day India like Bombay, Madras, UP etc. This was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a UP state passes a law banning say, cow slaughter then NWFP will pass a law banning public celebration of Diwali. This communalist tit for tat would've only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldn't have been confined to the border provinces of Punjab and Bengal but would've engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent. There would be riots in Sindh and in retaliation there would be riots in Kerala. 

In foreign policy terms India would have a restive Muslim population in Pakistan which would look for third party support from fellow Muslim nations of Iran and Afghanistan. This would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with Pashtuns in the case of Pakistan and Balochis in the case of Iran, crudely the Indus river actually is the real dividing line between Indian people and iranic people. The Indian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the Pakistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect. Pakistan has tried to pre empt Pashtun nationalism by raising up the Taliban to supplant it with Islamic radicalisation, an option not available to a Non Islamic Indian state. 

India would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in Central Asia and the middle East, both of the cold war (like Iran and Afghanistan) as well as the recent rise of Isis type Islamic extremism. This has nearly destroyed the Pakistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded India from the worst of it. The Punjabi Muslim (according to Ambedkar) was always the most susceptible to ideas of Muslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this (like with the Mujahideen). If these people were in the Indian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now, except now as citizens of India they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to Pakistan. 

In terms of economy, Ambedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day Pakistan were mostly a drag on the British exchequer while the Indian provinces were a tax surplus. This isn't necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between Hindu provinces and Muslim provinces then I struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great. Harmony is usually better for the economy than conflict.

The situation of minorities of all types would've been worse. Indian non muslims don't really care about the situation of their co religionists in Pakistan or Bangladesh. This is pretty much true for Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims as well with one huge exception being the Babri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in Bangladesh and Pakistan aimed at Hindus there, destroying temples and killing people etc. This wouldn't be the case in an undivided India, Hindu minorities in Muslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of Muslim minorities in Hindu provinces. This was an idea mooted solely by the Muslim league but I'm pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the Hindu communalists wouldn't be far behind in adopting this theory. Needless to say, not a good way to run a country.

People often say that India is secular only because it is 80% Hindu and I agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the Hindu faith, but because the question of religious hegemony in India is settled. The proportion of muslim in undivided India would've been large enough for the Hindus to start feeling threatened and for the Muslims to start demanding their pound of flesh (and maybe a bit more). The insecurity is highest at such a point where there's a chance of hegemonic change, it could've been a domestic variant of Thucydides Trap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country. Far better for one religious group to be in the outright, unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions.

Narendra Modi.

**Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?**

Because Narendra Modi and his government would not act against NPA companies. And also because draconian Demonetization was being planned.


**Why did Deputy RBI Governor Viral Acharya raise the issue of Section 7 of RBI Act and warn the Government?**

Because Government wanted to step in and take over the Reserves of 10,00,000+ Crores lying with RBI and use them to plug NPA's.


**Why does the Government want all this money?**

Because banks have been rendered empty and the 4,00,000 Crore windfall gain from Demonetization never happened.


**Why companies are declaring NPA's?**

Because their business have failed due to a failing and failing economy.


**But is the economy not doing very well under Narendra Modi?**

If that was the case, there was no need to take over RBI Reserves. The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.


**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**

Because many companies were declaring NPA's and the biggest shock came when IL&FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.


**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**

Because that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.


**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**

Prices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.



**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**

It is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.



**Why GST Collection has fallen?**

Because it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.



**Why Business Volume has fallen?**

If you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can't expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.



**What is the immediate danger?**

Telecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.


**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**

Former CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.



**Who is responsible for all this mess?**
Of course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months. Had Sardar Patel been the First PM, none of this might have happened.

**Who should resign?**

That's a stupid question!!! Of Course Sonia Gandhi should resign and Rahul Gandhi should resign as Congress President and Modi should be given a free hand with the 10,00,000 Crore RBI Reserves to do what he wants to do.


**Who should you vote for in 2019?**

Of course Narendra Modi, because he is the 11th Incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes 'care' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too. He is the only person who can buy 36 jets instead of 126 jets by paying the same price and convince you without giving you any data that 36 > 126 and he has in fact saved money for the nation and yet managed to give 30,000 Crores to friend Anil Ambani.

Because there is no other person in the whole country who is more qualified than him with his MA in 'Entire Political Science' and a missing BA.

Now how dare you think of voting for anyone else?""
",57," *Chaliye OP ko Wanakkam!* The RBI fiasco indicates there are bigger skeletons in the closet. Whether it is the banks or telecom or someone else, only time will tell. > Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?

As far as i remember, he wasnt given an extension. So if he wanted to continue he would have to follow the same procedure of appointment of an RBI governor along with other contenders i.e. being interviewed by a panel headed by the Cabinet Secretary. Just this fact is enough for a person of high repute to resign.

The reasons you mentioned are relevant as well. But RR didnt step down, he was never given an extension.  [Citation needed] Your username emplies obvious bias here.  If the economy was failing then Moody's wouldn't have upgraded Indias credit rating from Baa3 to Baa2.

Just this time we are giving it away intentionally. Ohohohoho this will burn right through the asshole of many fellow Indians 😂😂 To put this in perspective, consider that UK has to navigate Brexit. They actually know the importance of the post of governor of central bank.You cant let politics dictate the appointment of such critical posts.Or even appoint a parrot to that post.The very minute changes in central bank has far-reaching effects in the coming years.

People underestimate the power and influence of governor of the central bank in the economy.Since his policy changes don't produce immediate results(for the common man) and takes mostly 1-2 years to show any signs.

Some people think that lowering the interest rates are the only thing the RBI chief does and if he does only that, everything will be great. TIL that Raghuram Rajan's father, R Govindararajan was a spy. ITS A PLAN.

Now he will have full access to Vijay Mallya's bank accounts in London :) And we Indians like to crib about brain drain and how everyone talented works elsewhere. If you don't make use of great talent, someone else will. 

 It will be a big advantage for Bank of England if Raghram Rajan become head of their institution.A great economist,intelligent man our government discarded him and brought a puppet to run RBI,England taking second Kohinoor from India. Nice! [removed] Shobha de moves to London.  I'm happy for him, I'm sad for myself and India. I laugh at modiji when he says Pratibha Palayan.  Not a hope.

He would turn it down himself unless the political winds turned. Head of a sinking ship is a dumb role to take. He deserves this position but Indians do not deserve great economist.
Indian Politics SUCKS... He did not give a fuck to indian politicians.
CHEERS... Watch idiots of our country go on a rant about how he’s bowing to our colonial overlords and how he has no self respect as an Indian He was in the longlist for US fed chairman post too. Let's not kid ourselves here. The lists may be diverse, but most likely the post will be filled by a white man. As it was with the fed: Jerome Powell. He was intelligent and charismatic enough to capture the attention of people or youth especially who otherwise have zero interest in Indian bureaucracy or administration.


Govt should have desperately tried to hold onto him ,on the contrary they worked out of bounds to get rid of him. [removed] No big deal, we have intellectuals like Sambit Patra and Venkaiah Naidu.  Oh, this must hit the Hindutva brigand brigade hard.

I sincerely hope he wins it. And if he does, these guys will claim he is anti-national, not recognizing the fact that it is ironical.

 Knew this was Modi's plan all along.

/s He is the best at his job, as he says :

I'm Raghuram Rajan, and I do what I do. I hope he turns things around as he did with India Only person who must be feeling sad about this is Manmohan Singh, who personally requested, hand picked or whatever you call it, Mr.Rajan to be RBI's Governor. It's sad to know he may never return, but glad he is being recognized so well in a 1st world country. Good luck for the race, you logical Indian.

 ______ 
**India Retains Position As Fastest Growing Economy, GDP Growth Accelerates To 7.7% In Q4** 

 ______ 
India retained its position as the world's fastest growing major economy in
the January-March quarter, well ahead of China. India's

GDP or gross domestic product

growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the March quarter - the fastest pace of
growth in seven quarters. Strong growth in agriculture (4.5 per cent),
manufacturing (9.1 per cent) and construction sectors (11.5 per cent)
contributed to the overall growth. Growth for Asia's third-largest economy,
reported by the Ministry of Statistics, trumped forecasts in a Reuters poll
for annual growth of 7.3 per cent. GDP had grown at a revised 7 per cent in
October-December quarter.

For the full year (2017-18), GDP expanded at 6.7 per cent, lower than the 7.1
per cent recorded in the previous year.

Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said: ""Today's GDP number is very
comforting and should put a lot of concerns to rest. It seems like we have
moved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation. The pick-up
in investment activity (fixed capital formation) is also a good sign.""  
  
The faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might also strengthen
expectations for a rate hike by the RBI later this year. ""We expect RBI to
revise its policy stance in June and follow it up with a hike of 25 bps in
August policy,"" said Garima Kapoor, economist and vice president at Elara
Capital.  

Many economists expect India's economy to grow more than 7 per cent in
2018-19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pickup in private investment.

Though global rating agency

Moody's earlier this week

cut its GDP growth forecast for India due to higher oil prices and tighter
financial conditions, it still expects the country's GDP to expand by 7.3 per
cent this fiscal year.

GDP growth in 2018-19 could get a boost from prospects of good monsoon,
potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.

Economists also point out to many risk factors that could put downward
pressure on GDP growth. Possibly, the biggest risk could be rising crude oil
prices, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014. India
meets 80 per cent of its oil needs from imports.

Domestic

prices of petrol and diesel

are near all-time highs, putting pressure on the government to bring down
taxes on the fuels.

Rising oil prices could also weigh on the consumer demand, say economists. The
government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per
barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.

Higher crude oil prices have already hurt the rupee, which slumped to near a
record low this month. It is down about 6 per cent so far this year against
the US dollar.

__ Comments

Banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, has remained weak
following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new
loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted
for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector
in 2017.

Separately, infrastructure sector recorded a 4.7 per cent growth in April, as
against 2.6 per cent a year ago, data released by government showed.

168,99b2zl,Dr Manmohan Singh is the Real GDP King; Jaitley’s Blog cannot Change it,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/dr-manmohan-singh-is-the-real-gdp-king-fm-jaitleys-blog-cannot-change-it,Policy/Economy,,15," > The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing 

Cool. > The Modi government has once again got a panic attack. The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing caused it. The underlying reason behind the alarming palpitations is a research panel of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releasing a back-series adjusted GDP based on 2011-12 prices to make GDP comparisons dispassionate shorn of political googlies. This would enable holistic policy-making besides providing fodder for rigorous academic reasoning. **The Bharatiya Janata Party’s acute nervousness was on account of two manifestations of the sub-committee’s findings:**

> - 1) As expected, UPA-1 ( 2004-09) had a record-breaking five-year average GDP growth of 8.87%, an unprecedented score in India’s history.

> - 2) Even the much-maligned, badgered UPA-2 had a more impressive lead over the headline-grabbing hyperbolic NDA, 7.39% as against 7.2%.

> **Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote a hurried, poorly researched rhetorical blog**, Niti Aayog chief put out a few dubious tweets as a diversionary tactic ...

> ... Jaitley & co made an embarrassingly phlegmatic attempt to puncture UPA-1’s triumphant performance. **According to them, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a booming 8.1% GDP growth from the Vajpayee government** in 2003-04 and just rode a providential bonanza thereafter ... **What he artfully dodges is that in the preceding year of 2001-02, the GDP had touched a nadir of 3.7% , even lower than the 3.9% of 2000-01** ... **Truth be said, NDA-1 just about averaged 5.6%**, and was easily outclassed by the formidable Dr Singh-P Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia triumvirate.

> ... Jaitley then caustically refers to fiscal profligacy of average 5% of GDP under UPA, while selectively ignoring that under NDA-1 fiscal deficit was higher at 5.5% . That is called cherry-picking. **Under NDA-1 the average crude oil price was around $30 per barrel, while under UPA that skyrocketed to over $145 at one stage**; Jaitley has a memory loss of this stupendous escalation when discussing the inflationary impact. Yet, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in human history happened during UPA; **poverty declined by over two-and-a-half times than under NDA and 140 million people were lifted out of poverty, the second largest ever after China.** Naturally, Jaitley did not mention this crucial statistic in India’s celebrated growth story under Dr Singh. A pity, really.

> ... **agriculture under UPA grew at an annualised 3.6%, while it was 2.2% under NDA-1.** Private consumption went up 40% faster under the UPA as did private disposable income at 20% as compared to NDA’s 8.3%. At core, **both the rural farmers and urban dwellers were better off under Dr Singh.** ...

> Jaitley is being mendacious with facts when he talks of alleged scams ... The tradition has continued in NDA-2 with Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai Choksi and some other close buddies of the current dispensation ...

> ... **UPA-2 (7.39) has outperformed NDA-2 (7.2%) as well by a convincing margin** despite overwhelming headwinds; I list four of them.

> **First, UPA-2 faced the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007/8** which literally incinerated economies worldwide. It’s ramifications were both geographically spread (the Eurozone crisis) as well as structurally penetrative. It was the world’s most testing survival period after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

> **Secondly, oil prices reached a dizzying average of over $110 a barrel**, creating a massive pressure on current account deficit and fiscal deficit, and adding to an inflationary spiral. 

> **Third, UPA had a coalition government** and thus required circumspect calibration in policy-making which was done with adroit political maturity through consensus building. 

> **Fourth, it was actually parliamentary paralysis** (which Jaitley famously described as legitimate political strategy) forced by a belligerent BJP that created a gridlock and prevented the GST and several legislation from becoming a reality during UPA’s tenure.

> **Yet, UPA-2 has done better than NDA-2, who have had the tailwind of oil prices at $28 at one stage, low inflation, a majority government, growing world economy and above all, a strong inheritance of a robust recovering economy from the UPA-2 of 6.4%. Incidentally, UPA crossed double-digit growth rates twice during its 10-year period.** GONNA VOTE FOR CONGRESS. he is also King of Inflation.

Here is a brief list to answer your question Mister Prime Minister:

1. For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

2. For destroying the traditional plural culture of our ancient land via organised polarisation - not just religious, but also regional, linguistic and cultural.

3. For destroying the profound teachings of Hinduism/ Sanatan Dharma by placing Savarkar's fascist Hindutva as Hinduism.

4. For continuing the charade of fake nationalism when your deeds and policies are only harming India.

5. For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - especially the Zionist global banking cartel.

6. For false promises and falsehoods which are being spread through multiple channels everyday.

7. For violating the principles of the Indian Constitution by introducing theocratic militant nationalism and anti-privacy/ anti-freedom Aadhaar.

8. For destroying the pillars of Democracy by de-fanging media and institutions - which are critical to offer any semblance of truth and justice.

9. For not listening to people and the diversity of voices - but to impose dictates via coercion and intimidation.

10. For being anti-intellectual and actively promoting the hatred of the learned and the educated.

11. For doing all the tricks in the book to curb dissent and freedom of expression.

12. For sinking all the human development indexes since 2014.

13. For waging a fake 'morality play 'of anti-corruption crusade when the real policies of the government point to the opposite direction.

14. For hiding from unscripted questions which the people want to ask you - no single press conference since you came to power.

15. For focussing on PR, publicity, events and propaganda, but not the real issues of the nation.

16. For ruining India's traditional 'non-aligned' foreign policy.

17. For instigating the ego - hate and greed - through your theatrical 'carrot and stick' speeches.

18. For surrounding yourself with sycophants who have no talent for governance.

19. For being obsessive about grandiose ideas/ misplaced priorities and failing to deliver.

20. For misunderstanding the meaning of 'development' by neglecting social justice.

21. For being pro-super-rich and putting the poor and the Middle class under the technocratic Neoliberal Economic policies which have hollowed out the West.

22. For raging a war against India via the toxic brew of Hindutva and Neoliberalism, and destroying the people's faith and trust upon the government.

And you ask, what I have done to deserve this? Hahahahaha. Like always, Mudiji ne toh rhetoric question pucha tha. Launda serious ho gaya.  I still remember the height of his popularity in 2014, the man has come crashing down hard. With so much popularity and full numbers in the house, he would have easily assured another term if he had only surrounded himself who wasn't an ass-licker !! RIP Devdan Chaudhari. Either dead or arrested. 😰 Reading his 22 points made me realize that there are only more to add, nothing to reduce. Very well said. I hope modi reads it. Randia linking to Scoopwhoop which links to FB... this is a postception! 21 Reasons Why > Global Zionist banking cartel

Hindu-Yahoodi saazish. ..23 The fact that people worry about getting Vyapamed simply for liking or sharing this post Vyapamed in 3.....2.... I was a Modi supporter, even voted for him in 2014 just because other options weren't half as good as him. Obviously, who didn't think of him as a Messiah who'd save this country from Congress. 
Today, I couldn't have been more wrong, he's just all-talk no-work guy who promises amazing things, failed to deliver any of it. 
However, in my family, almost 95% of them are still pro-Modi, and they buy into each argument he makes. Each time, I try to reason with them, a staple dialogue of ""Congress ruled for 60 years, that shit can't be washed in 5 years"" is thrown around. Only the ones in Reddit, specifically r/India even talk about reason, whereas the entire community still believes in him.  chaiwala samajh nahi paayega I am from Banaras and lot of (read everyone) people in my social circle were a fan of Modi. People were hoping that he would do same to Banaras what Atal Ji did to Lucknow. They were very excited. Then I had to move to another country but when I returned back for vacations a lot of my friend were furious. They were unhappy that Modi allowed Yogi to be CM of UP. They voted for development and didn't expect such a dick move from him. We young generation from UP is really fed up with caste and religion politics. We want development and jobs. But what we got? Again same old shit. I was at least relieved that my friends are not fanboys. Some old people have also started criticizing Modi. They are also tired of religion shit and want jobs for their sons in the state.  inb4 he gets lynched, gets called out for being anti-nationalist, and is told to go to pakistan if he doesn't like it here. Modi is a chutiya of the highest order. Even if BJP wins in 2019 hope he gets kicked out along with that moron Amit Shah. > For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - **especially the Zionist global banking cartel**

Who is the fascist? if some muslim guy wrote this, he ll be picked up by pulis in middle of night. Agree with most but some of the points about Zionist Banking etc are just ridiculous and portrays the intellect of the writer in poor light.  He gon git arrested Ahh antisemetism looked over cause it’s anti Modi too? He can be arrested for Facebook post  Now that it's pretty evident  whose winning in Gujarat such articles would come out in full force
BTW when did Scoopwhoop become relevant ? lol, author is a conspiracy nut. Modi is supporting zionist banking cartel it seems, LOL The work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done. I do not think so far anybody else has done the work like him. >For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

First one. Is this true? Last numbers I heard is that Indias growth is over 6% and [is expected to continue](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2015/01/14/india-china-gdp-growth-world-bank.jpg). Also, Chinas lead is decreasing. 

If this is economy ""destroyed"" what word is he using when growth is negative? 

Im not being facetious. Im genuinely wondering if economy is now destroyed. What are his indicators that this is the case. Seriously NAM ? Are living in sixties ? We Signed a defense cooperation treaty in 1960s which saved our ass against American nuclear missiles.

And had Israeli technology helping our army during Kargil.

The Nam countries didnt give a fuck when China attacked us in 1962.

Modi is just following what Congress was doing in 10 years who themselves were continuing the good work of Previous governments.

Criticizing the govt for it is just clueless. modi is much better than congrees if not the best.atleast he is doing something for the nation and taking risks unlike congress.
tell me a better option than bjp so that i can use my vote in a good way in 2019.

Did he just admit that Demonetisation was a failure? Should we then judge him on:

- Imposing an Adhaar which was meant only for public distribution service on everyone in an orwellian way.

- Having the worst record for job creation. 

- Residing over the worst private investment record since 1950's.

Edit: - A Rafale deal which was steeped in crony capitalism.

- Increasing income inequality.

- Enriching babaji's who masquerade as spiritual gurus. Providing them army to build bridges for private events and suppressing activists who protest against environmental destruction for other babaji's from the south.

- Taking advice on demonotisation from a babaji who on behalf of a quack think tank reccomended demonitisation to Mudi.

- Completley bending foreign policy to the west and not adhering to decades of non aligned status. 

- Almost selling off and destroying India's generics industry in the first 6 months of power which would have made basic drugs cost an arm and a leg to attract 'fdi' only to see a backlash.

- Completely disintegrating out military industrial complex that was on the verge of next gen technology only to buy equipment from foreign companies with zero transfer of technology so foreigners and crony capitalists can profit

- Paying zero attention to the agriculture sector which has been completely destroyed.

- Paying no attention no attention to SME sector which is dying without credit while behaving like an NRI prime minister and begging foreign firms to make in India

- Throwing Rajan out to help his crony capitalist friends; i.e so they don't have to pay back their loans

- Spending billions on novelty projects like trains while making no investments in healthcare.

- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive

- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.

- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.

- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation

- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.

- furthering Hindutva/cow politics  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.

- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.

- Lying about building electricity access and infrastructure at a faster pace.

- Looting money from the public through various cess's like Swach Bharat etc.

- Trying to destroy the environment in order to build infrastructure including vast tracts of forest. Ok... let's talk cow vigilantism? Or moral policing? Or hate speeches? Or rising intolerance? Or the failure of clean Ganga? Or swachh Bharat? Or let's talk about Adityanath becoming a dictator? Or the lack of a policy on Pakistan? Or China making inroads in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal?

**Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged the nation to not judge him only
on the basis of his decisions to implement demonetisation and GST. “Don’t
evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, we brought economic reform, built
toilets, brought electricity to 18000 villages,” PM Modi said in an exclusive
interview with Zee News.

Talking about his global approach, the Prime Minister who recently hosted his
Israeli counterpart in New Delhi and Gujarat said, “They said my understanding
was limited to Gujarat. I made it my strength. I did not follow protocol, I
was a simple man with no baggage. I made friends the world over.”

On the upcoming World Economic Forum, Modi said that the world wants to hear
“directly from the Horse’s mouth.” The PM also talked about India’s policies
and growth potential and expressed that he felt proud to represent India in
Davos.

Stating that the Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, PM Modi said the
Davos meet is a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with
the strength of demographic dividend. “The country is seeing the biggest jump
in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is natural that the world wants to talk
directly to India and the world wants to hear directly from the horse’s mouth
about India’s policies and potential. It matters if you hear it from the
leader,” he added.

Meanwhile, Modi also stressed on his push for conducting simultaneous polls
for Lok Sabha and state assemblies and said that like festivals it should be
held on fixed schedule.

**Modi may be the last hope for the Indian economy to achieve greatness** 

 ______ 
Recent weeks have witnessed an enormous amount of hand-wringing in the press
about India’s economy. These articles share a common thematic trajectory: they
start with a recitation of statistics that highlight a slowdown, lay it on the
doorsteps of demonetisation and GST, and in the grand tradition of the blood-
sport which is Indian politics, either use these statistics to settle personal
scores, or, as in the case of the political opposition, use it to prepare
oneself for 2019 with nervous glee. None of this hand-wringing is accompanied
with any insight or solutions beyond the obvious.

The fox knows many things. The hedgehog knows one important thing.

In a now famous essay written when he was an Oxford Don in the 1930’s, Isaiah
Berlin classified people into foxes and hedgehogs as a means of making a
distinction about people and the different ways in which they confront
reality. Foxes, according to Berlin, may know many things, but a coherent
worldview is beyond their comprehension. The hedgehog, however, knows one
great truth, and steadfast in its pursuit, remains unreconciled until he/she
reaches it.

This parable is perhaps the best way to understand Narendra Modi and his
actions surrounding the economy. Modi is the hedgehog who knows what India
needs to do to become prosperous, but importantly, is also willing to act upon
it. Indeed, he may be the only politician in contemporary Indian history who
has undertaken structural reforms out of choice rather than, like Narasimha
Rao in the 1990’s, being compelled to do so.

Structural reform is thankless: costs are borne upfront, and rewards come
later. (The currency for this transaction is political capital, and Arun
Jaitley has paid the most for his role as the able knight who is the face of
such change.) For years, it was the very absence of these structural reforms
that armchair foxes have bemoaned. Now that the reforms are occurring, the
foxes are coming out of the forest, and unwilling to pay the price, claim that
these are ill-timed, ill-conceived or ill-executed.

Through his decade-long executive leadership of one of India’s richest states,
Modi knows what the foxes don’t: First, that there’s never a right time to
make a hard choice, and second, the slowdown is the result of a fundamental
fragility of the Indian economy baked into India’s economic foundation at its
creation: the government’s overwhelming role in the economy.

Modi is seeking to eliminate this fragility by recalibrating the entire engine
of India’s economic growth methodically: Jaitley’s increasing of the states’
share in the divisible pool of union taxes in 2015,
digitisation/demonetisation of the economy in 2016, the GST in 2017, Piyush
Goyal’s work in the power sector over the last three years, Nitin Gadkari’s
ongoing work in transportation, all are transformative and quantifiable
contributors to the structure of the economy, and designed to create a robust
and higher equilibrium for the Indian economy from which it can propel itself
higher.

That these reforms are happening without any taint on any senior politician of
the government is in itself a first in India’s modern history. The republic
was lucky to survive through years of pillage under the Congress, and if it
were nothing else but just that the BJP is taint-free, we would still have
much to be thankful for.

But Modi’s toughest test is yet to come. Just as Modi fought the culture wars
and reshaped our national discourse on identity and nationhood for all time,
and just as how he is transforming India’s foreign policy through a new Modi-
doctrine, he must now dismantle the greatest vestige of Jawaharlal Nehru’s and
Indira Gandhi’s legacy: the socialist superstructure that is the curse of
India. Only when he is finished, will he have succeeded in his undeclared
personal ambition: to bury Nehru and Indira Gandhi forever.

To do so involves treating the economic organisation of a society not merely
in transactional terms, but as a moral issue inextricably linked to individual
rights and dignity, and moving wholeheartedly towards the only economic system
that provides for such: a free-market system adapted to help those on India’s
economic margins.

In doing so, he would do well to reduce his reliance on ever wiser economic
councils and bureaucrats, but follow his hedgehog instincts which have yielded
such sharp results in foreign policy and India’s culture wars. (As an aside, I
note with some amusement a lesson from my first class in economics with
Professor Jagdish Bhagwati: “India did so badly in the 50’s and 60’s not
because it had too few economists, but because it had too many!”)

This then, is the call to arms. In addition to a dogged focus on anti-
corruption (a necessary issue for 2014 but insufficiently ambitious for 2019),
Modi needs to speak to the country in civilisational terms about the manner of
its economic organisation, and seek the mandate to put the nation on the path
to double-digit growth for decades to come.

In practical terms, and as a first step, it requires the sale of the
government-owned banks and PSU’s in their entirety. Not re-capitalisation, not
mere NPA-resolution, not partial-disinvestment of loss-making PSU’s etc. A
complete sale. These are giant black holes that destroy capital, or at best,
use it sub-optimally. Modi cannot rebuild a nation without removing the
termites from its foundation.

By seizing the time still available in 2017-2019 (and perhaps for five years
thereafter), Modi may still live up to his own revolutionary declaration of
2014: “Government has no role in business”. Modi may represent the last best
hope for the Indian economy to achieve true greatness. If Modi doesn’t do it
now, India will be condemned to this middling, snakes-and-ladder growth
pattern for another several generations.

If not Modi, then who? If not now, then when?

The hedgehog knows.

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",82," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former.

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**It’s time Modi government stopped blaming RBI** 

 ______ 
Overall, the Narendra government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Photo: PTI

Before the six-member committee that sets monetary policy for the Reserve Bank of India met this week, the government in New Delhi made its preferences very clear. Two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council—a body that he did without for a long time, but which was recently reconstituted following several policy stumbles—publicly declared that real interest rates were too high. But the RBI committee held firm and kept India’s policy interest rate at six percent.

This could have been, and was, predicted. India’s central bank is now officially supposed to be targeting consumer price inflation and nothing else; the government agreed to this change over a year ago. And inflation has been inching up, driven by higher prices for food and fuel. In October, consumer price inflation was the highest in seven months.

Formal requirements apart, of course, it would’ve been hard for the central bank to ignore the government’s pleas if the economy were stalled. But the government achieved something of a victory last week when GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 came in at 6.3%, slightly faster than in the first quarter. That eliminated pressure on the RBI to cut rates and stimulate investment. Instead, the central bank’s priority is guarding against the possibility that higher growth will begin to affect wages—and, in particular, real estate prices, which the RBI singled out for attention in its policy statement.

This illustrates the government’s great dilemma. Growth in India never quite slows down enough to make crisis measures necessary. Yet it never quite speeds up enough to satisfy the aspirations of Modi, his party and his voters (not to mention his critics). The couple things the government has gotten right in the past few months—its attempts to streamline the new goods-and-services tax and its determined approach to cleaning up distressed assets—haven’t been dramatic enough either to ease the RBI’s worries or to push the economy to a permanently higher growth path.

Overall, this government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Now it’s clear that the RBI won’t bail it out; the best chance for lower rates may have passed. Any revival of private investment—which, as a proportion of GDP, was even lower in the second quarter than the first—will have to come from somewhere else.

Frankly, if the government is serious about a growth revival, it will have to return to the drawing board. It still has time and political capital to spare before it has to face the voters in 2019. There is an entire set of reforms that it hasn’t touched since its first few months in power: to India’s problematic labour markets, for example, or to the ways available to industry and developers to acquire agricultural land.

Recently, India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, insisted that India would become a $10-trillion dollar economy by 2030. That would mean moving toward double-digit growth in dollar terms very soon. Yet there’s no indication of that on the horizon. Frankly, the signs to me aren’t propitious. While the growth slowdown may have reversed, part of that was simply a dead-cat bounce. Manufacturers who had stopped production to de-stock before the introduction of the new GST started up again in the second quarter. That’s hardly sustainable.

Nor is the government capable of intervening itself to prop up growth. In fact, it’s running out of money to keep stimulating the economy: It has already run through most of its fiscal deficit cushion for the year, and the RBI flagged the fiscal stresses caused by higher pay for government employees and Indian states’ mad competition to forgive agricultural debt. Nor are there really any signs, even anecdotally, of renewed investment in India’s private sector.

It’s hard to see 6.3% growth as a major achievement in India. As the RBI pointed out, it’s not a disaster. But, if the government is honest with itself, it’s not a triumph either. It’s time that Modi, his ministers and his advisers turned to the many reforms they’ve left pending—and stopped blaming the RBI. Bloomberg View

 ______ 
If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

Bolo kaunsi chahiye 🤣 I know of two such men, both my friend's uncles. 

They're both Muslims from Hyderabad. 

One uncle married a Gujarati Hindu (she had to convert). The wife is a US citizen. Her family has businesses in Chicago and this guy inherited those too. They have two kids. As far as I know, their marriage works well enough. 

Another uncle married an American born daughter of Pakistani Muslim immigrants. She doesn't follow Islam and drinks alcohol, which this guy didn't like, but still went ahead with the marriage. She turned out to be very abusive. The guy was admitted twice to a hospital during the few years of their marriage. He has a son, so he's staying in the marriage for his sake. It's not unheard of when one partner is Indian origin person who got citizenship earlier. Infact, a close friend of mine got into an arranged marriage with a keralite girl with British citizenship and moved. It's probably more common among keralites though. They're experts in migration. I did it. My wife is actually an ex Victoria's Secret model as well. That seems to be one nasty way to emigrate. I believe women might have more chances than men.

**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** 

 ______ 
A senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after
he got a call from goods and services tax (

GST

) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the
construction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for
the executive to explain that the word ""stone"" in the brand name had nothing
to do with the business the firm was into.

Few kilometres away from the PE firm's office in

Mumbai

, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was
nervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's

GST assessing officer

, and it left him in knots.

""How does one explain credit

swap

ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?"" he asked his
chartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some
queries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.

As the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of
erstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies
are running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with
manufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with
service companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.

But under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared
and all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile
VAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.

Many of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately
asking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.

""There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to
voice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing
authorities.

Several service providers, whose business models are well known to the central
authorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are
apprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on
taxation of services,"" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte

India

.

Industry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment
officers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair
like in the case of income tax. ""One has to deal with officials for refunds,
credits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some
time before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,"" the senior
finance executive in the PE firm said.

The government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and
dividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just
for PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.

Take the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about
Rs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials
for the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.

Another diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out
an SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants
former state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.

The manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his
assessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are
somewhat unfounded. ""Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of
changing their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has
undergone training and there is no need to worry,"" a government official in
the know clarified.

""Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods
and they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials
were given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried
several services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,"" said
Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,

KPMG India

.

The worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a
complex subject. ""One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because
the tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,"" he laughs. ""However, I
would say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they
don't understand, and it may just be a good thing.""

But not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions
which are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The
tax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the
firm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know
how come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for ""merely
talking for half an hour"" from a client, but not charging anything from
another client with whom she had spoken for two hours.

""It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is
complex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were
allotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,"" a senior tax
advisor said.

  NEW DELHI: Apple wants the government to relax labelling rules so that it doesn't have to print product-related information directly onto devices to avoid cluttering up their minimalist design. That's one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said.  

 

  The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) forwarded the iPhone maker’s request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) in November for consideration, said another official. The company manufactures its products in six countries, with most being made in China.  

 

  

 

 

  Apple's distinctive design language is integral to product appeal and it strives to keep surfaces as free of artefacts as possible. The company wants to provide the product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging. The labelling issue will be dealt with by DeITY, the official said.  

 

  The company has also sought tax incentives that are being examined by the finance ministry. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple did not respond to queries.  

 

  The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm. The company had sought the exemption on the grounds that it was bringing ""state-of-the-art"" and “cutting-edge technology,"" making it difficult to meet the sourcing condition.  

 

  During his visit to the country earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said India was its next big market. PM Narendra Modi had urged Cook to set up factories to make its products in India.

Fitch Rating (Representational Image) Fitch Rating (Representational Image)

Despite a continued pitch from the government and corporates for an upgrade, global rating agency Fitch Ratings has kept its sovereign rating on India unchanged, citing weak public finances. In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India’s strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government’s finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India’s sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India’s rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.

India’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‘BBB-’. “India’s sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government’s structural reform agenda,” it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, “Why is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.”

“Italian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,” he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India’s ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‘BBB’ median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.

Fitch said India’s economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‘BBB’ range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‘BBB’ median of 58th percentile).

An official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. “It remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is “largely a tax non-compliant society”, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government’s FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

“Significant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,” it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.

**Stand-up India: Key to developing entrepreneurs from underprivileged sections of society is mentoring** 

 ______ 
Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood.

Indian startups have captured global attention, attracted venture capital and achieved notable success in recent years. Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.

Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.

In the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.

Helping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.

Mentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.

Another example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.

Such handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.

Shanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‘Vivikura’. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.

We have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.

Under the Government’s MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.

**‘The party will be over’: How GST will affect businesses that don’t pay tax** 

 ______ 
Rakesh Sachdeva sells auto parts in a busy market in central Delhi, just a few miles from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office. Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax.

Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India’s tax officials. Come July 1, however, “the party will be over”, says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug.

A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country’s biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva’s into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India’s sovereign credit profile.

The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors.

Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don’t sign up risk losing any customer who has.

“I have no option, but to register with the new system,” said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.

Boosting the coffers

Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy.

India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6%, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies.

While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.

“In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,” Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters. “Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.”

Nair’s company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant.

Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders.

A REVAMP 17 YEARS IN THE MAKING India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth. Timeline of the long journey to GST rollout:

May: GST Council during its meet in Srinagar fixes rates of goods and services India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth.

Winners and losers

The unorganised sector of India’s economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers.

While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms’ accounting systems and an investment in technology.

The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India’s 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line.

Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders’ body in Delhi, reckons a “prohibitive” cost could prove to be counterproductive.

“Compliance is needed for input tax credit,” he said. “But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?”

But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation.

The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently.

Firms can now move to demand-based “hub-and-spoke” models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.

“Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,” said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai. “All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.”

Didn't these firms have a sales tax number before?

Companies buying from them earlier would have surely shown whatever they purchased as expenses in their tax filing (I am not talking about tax credit, just expenses in a P & L statement). Now for showing these purchases as expenses, they would have needed a bill/receipt/invoice from these firms. For that these firms would need to have a Sales Tax Number.

**Au Small Finance Bank IPO; here’s what 8 brokerages say** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: AU Small Finance Bank is all set to hit the market with an initial public offering ( IPO ) on Wednesday. On offer are 53.42 million shares in the price band of Rs 355-358 apiece. The issue will close on Friday.The Jaipur-based company, which has got RBI licence to engage in small finance banking, has already commenced operations. With a network of 300 branches spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, the lender used to serve across 10 states as a non-banking finance company ( NBFC ) – AU Financiers – before foraying into the small finance bank space.Here’s what brokerages said on the IPO:AU Small Finance Bank (AU SFB) is a small finance bank that recently transitioned from a retail-focused NBFC and primarily serves low and middle income individuals and businesses. Started in 1996, the company’s business primarily was focused on vehicle finance. The company later ventured into MSME and SME loans. AU SFB commenced business as a small finance bank on April 19, 2017. The transition to SFB has offered AU SFB significant growth potential and will help deliver improved performance and return ratios. At the upper band of the price band at Rs 358, the post-money valuation of AU SFB is at 5.3 times P/ABV FY17 of Rs 68, which we believe, leaves little scope for any upside in the near term. Hence we recommend investors to subscribe to the issue only with a long-term investment horizon.AU SFB’s gross AUM has grown at a CAGR of 30 per cent over FY13-17 on account of sectoral tail winds such as a financial inclusion drive and low credit penetration in certain areas of the country. These growth drivers are likely to persist over the longer term. As a result, AU SFB should continue its record high growth rate on its loan book.Further, AU SFB has successfully diversified its loan book composition that has helped it reduce concentration risk and improve asset quality. Out of the total loan book, 98.99 per cent is backed by revenue-generating assets. Also, LTVs of 80-85 per cent on showroom prices for vehicles loans and 40 per cent for MSME/SME loans are indicative of high-quality loan underwriting and risk management practices at AU SFB.Its initiation into housing finance and unsecured lending in FY18 should aid further diversification of the loan book. Given that the management has strong operational experience in housing finance and has an excellent track record of scaling up the same, we are confident that its initiation of housing finance will only add to profitable growth for AU SFB besides achieving diversification and risk management objectives. AU SFB has also displayed strong focus on optimising costs to keep profitability levels high. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 358, issue is priced at 5.1 times FY17 book value. Based on the management’s successful track-record of scaling up the business over the years, generating high returns (better RoAE than peers), focus on optimising costs, well-established framework for controlling asset quality and well-thought-out future expansion strategy, we recommend subscribe rating to long-term investors.In its earlier avatar as an NBFC, AU grew its gross loan assets and earnings at a robust CAGR of 34 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, over FY14-17. The brisk AUM growth was complemented by its business diversity, both in terms of products and geographies. Profitability grew by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding persistent investments on the back of moderation in funding cost and firm control on product pricing.Post SFB launch, growth and profitability would be restricted; but the longer-run prospects seem bright. Its conversion into SFB will augment earnings diversity and stability. The IPO of 53.4 million shares is a 100 per cent offer for sale; with the promoters divesting 9 million shares after which they would bring down their holding to 33 per cent.At the upper end of the price band of Rs 355-358, the stock is being valued at 5.3 times FY17 P/ABV. In our view, this valuation, more than being palatable, offers a material upside post listing. We recommend a subscribe rating.While the trailing valuation of 5.1 times FY17 P/BV may look expensive after taking a first look, this is a unique model with no exact peers. An important distinguishing factor is that Au SFB is a small finance bank and can raise deposits to keep the cost of funds low, unlike its peers. Therefore, the SFB model should do better compared to the NBFC model in the long run.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at a P/BV of 5.1 times on FY17, which is relatively higher than the peer group NBFCs. However, given the consistent track record of AU delivering high growth, better RoAs with contained asset quality issues vs peers, AU commands a premium valuation. At the offered valuation, we recommend a subscribe rating on the issue with a long-term view.Given the strong presence in niche customer segments, AU SFB’s profitability will be remain superior to most conventional banks, said the brokerage. “Despite the migration to SFB, we estimate that AU will report trough RoEs of 17 per cent in FY18 this will recover to 20 per cent by FY20. This is significantly better than its listed peers which are currently reporting single digit RoEs. As such, valuations at 3.2 times book on FY20 are reasonable, and investors can expect strong upside over the next few years,” it said.Its evolution from a DSA of HDFC Bank to a significant retail lending NBFC and outstanding performance track record suggest AU SFB has the potential to emerge as one of the most successful SFBs in three to five years. “We expect AU SFB to attract higher valuation premium compared to its peers led by sustainability of high growth in diversified business amid lower assets quality risk. At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, AU SFB’s market capitalisation would stand at Rs 102 billion, which gives it a price-to-book multiple of 5.1 times on March 2017 book value and P/E of 31.2 times on FY17 profit. We recommend subscribe rating to the issue, as it provides a favourable investment opportunity for long-term investors.At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, the issue is offered at 5.1 times its FY2017 BV. However, AU has reported a strong 48 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2013-17. “We believe it has the potential to deliver 30 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2017-19. Based on our quick estimates on FY2019 BV, the issue is offered at 3.5 times. While the issue is offered at premium valuations, we believe the valuation is justified given the historical track record and strong growth potential that SFB offers. We recommend subscribe rating on the issue,” the brokerage said.

not really indian context, but overall good resource for Finance/Banking 101 So disappointed with this thread! Really thought I'll get better answers than taking courses and reading textbooks. 

I feel the same way as you OP. I just don't know how to manage money and my biggest nightmare is that someone will cheat me out of it because I am too naive. Currently I get more than 5 calls per week asking me to invest in FDs at my bank. I have no idea about interest rates, I didnt even know my current balance earns an interest. I'd like some ""smart"" folk here to explain where I could invest my savings in a super simple but efficient way. I aint got no time to read my high school economics textbooks again. Seriously I don't remember a thing although I aced it. ;)

Recently I had to file taxes at my company and realised my parents have manipulated my name in not having a single thing to claim tax. I just sat down and wondered wtf is happening. Needless to say I couldn't claim. I have a pan card but it was handed to me by my dad who got it all done. So no fucking idea what happened there. 

I request someone here to tell me brielfly about things I discussed. (no links) thankyou! Search for business insider 25 most useful websites.1 site among that list teaches finance. Also add Taxation ,shares ,investment etc :) TTC lectures money and banking(paid)


Khan academy > To be more clear, I am a medical student

Consider finances and investing as a complex system (like the human body). Like for a healthy life, you don't *need* to understand the intricacies of the workings of the human body, similarly for good financial management and investing, you don't need to understand how and why of all those changes. 

> I don't know how or why the rates of oil, gold and the value of money changes, 

Most people, including investors, don't understand the reasons of those either. Don't go by the financial news networks explanations ex post facto. 

For the modern monetary system working, check out [this research article](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1905625). This is posted in terms of the US system, but applies on India too. 

> how the bank works 

Banks take money from the depositors (as money in the savings and current accounts, FD, etc) and lend them to those who need it. In the middle of this, they have their margin. Eg, the highest FD rates would be 8-9% while the lowest lending rates would be 11-13% (so the gap of 3-4% is their profit margin). This is the most basic idea.

**RBI revises definition of what constitutes a bank branch**

Reserve Bank of India (RBI), apart from reworking the definition of a bank branch, also widened the role of bank boards, making them responsible for complying with the new guidelines. Photo: Mint

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday relaxed the branch authorization policy, bringing all branches and fixed business correspondent outlets under the definition of banking outlets and removing restrictions on opening branches in Tier 1 centres.

According to the revised policy, RBI has defined “a banking outlet” for a scheduled commercial, a payments bank or a small finance bank as a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either the bank’s staff or its business correspondent, where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment of cheques, cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week”. Those outlets which do not meet this criteria will be called “part-time banking outlet.”

While the policy has removed restrictions on opening banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without taking RBI’s permission in each case, the regulator has mandated that banks open 25% of these outlets in unbanked rural centres (URC). Under the revised policy, a URC is defined as a “rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a core banking system (CBS)-enabled ‘banking outlet’ of a scheduled commercial bank, a small finance bank, a payment bank or a regional rural bank nor a branch of local area bank or licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions”.

With the expansion in definition of a branch, RBI has allowed all extension counters, satellite offices, part-shifted branches, ultra small branches and specialized branches, to be treated as ‘banking outlets’ or ‘part-time banking outlets’. However, ATMs, E-lobbies, bunch note acceptor machines ,cash deposit machines, e- kiosks and mobile branches will fall outside the purview of “banking outlets”. This is a shift from the earlier definition of a “branch” which also included off-site ATMs.

The proposal to rationalise the branch authorization policy was introduced under former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in the April 2016 monetary policy. “With a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach, keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided,” RBI had said in the policy statement.

Later an internal working group was set up, which came out with the draft report in October 2016. The key focus of the recommendations was to facilitate financial inclusion by ensuring availability of banking services in all centers through low-cost delivery channels.

The revised policy has also allowed small finance banks three years from the date of commencement of business to align their banking network with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as “banking outlets” though not immediately reckoning for the 25% norm. “Nevertheless, during this period of three years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in the same year,” RBI said.

“This policy will help in further penetration in rural areas and increase the profitability of the organization. We expect 10-15% more growth in the business with same set of branches we have projected,” said Munish Jain, chief operating officer of Capital Small Finance Bank.

**Regulatory reform fails to cut red tape: NITI Aayog** 

 ______ 
The survey conducted by NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country. Graphic: Mint

New Delhi: The big push by central and state governments to ease the regulatory environment notwithstanding, the perception of most business enterprises is that little has changed on the ground, a new survey has found.

The nationwide survey of the organized manufacturing sector was conducted jointly by the NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based think tank, to monitor the business environment in the country. It surveyed 3,276 enterprises, including 141 early-stage firms, across 23 categories.

Not only do the survey results serve as a wake-up call to the government and a reminder that the legacy of red tape is far more difficult to undo than what has been thought so far, it also reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country.

The results released on Monday showed that for a majority of respondents, parameters such as setting up a business, land and construction, environment, labour, water and sanitation, taxes, and access to finance remained the same compared with a year ago; on legal matters, they reported that things had worsened. The survey was conducted in 2016.

To be sure, a little over a third of the respondents did say that there was an improvement in ease of doing business, while about a fifth said procedures had deteriorated.

While 38% of the enterprises said that the regulatory environment for setting up a business had improved, the same proportion claimed nothing had changed and 21% said it had worsened. A large proportion (44%) of the enterprises said the regulatory framework for getting environment clearances had stayed the same while only 17% said it had worsened. Around 36% of the enterprises said that legal processes for resolving disputes had worsened while only 25% said they had improved. About 46% of enterprises said that access to finance had stayed the same while 36% said it had improved.

The World Bank, in its Doing Business survey report released last year, offered a plausible explanation. “The experience of implementing reforms based on doing business data has demonstrated to the government the significance of establishing clear stakeholder feedback mechanisms to close the gaps between policy formulation and implementation,” it said.

India’s ranking in the World Bank’s annual Doing Business survey improved by just one notch to 130 in its 2017 report from a revised rank of 131 last year. India is targeting a 40-notch jump in ranking in the upcoming survey, which is expected to be released in October.

The NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute survey also found that a substantial chunk of the enterprises surveyed were not aware of many of the improvements undertaken both by the Union and state governments.

On average, only about 20% of manufacturing start-ups were using the single-window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business. Even among experts, only 41% had any knowledge of the existence of these facilities. “Therefore, there is a clear need for creating greater awareness. In cases in which the lack of use is due to poor functioning of the service, the functioning must be improved,” the survey recommended.

Conceding that there was a communication gap, a person involved in overseeing the survey said that “every single company needs to be told about the changes taking place”.

Based on the results, the survey recommends more flexible labour laws to allow businesses to gain economies of scale. It also makes a strong case for states to open up their power distribution sector to private competition to lower costs and improve reliability.

Some analysts disagreed with the findings, claiming that the business climate has actually improved. “The robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) despite volatile global macroeconomic situation reflects the overall improvement in ease of doing business in India,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think tank.

FDI inflow in the April-June quarter jumped 37% to $10.7 billion compared with $7.6 billion received in the same period a year ago.

Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the survey along with information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said improving ease of doing business is getting the central government’s full attention.

**Banks wary of Modi government's merger plan for fear of loss of brand name** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is looking at consolidation of at least two state-run banks in this financial year, but some of the lenders identified for merger or takeover by bigger entities have expressed serious reservations on their identities being subsumed in the process.The target banks are keen that their names survive the consolidation and they continue to have a strong role in business operations, officials said. Earlier this year, four state-run banks – Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank – made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.“We have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.“These are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. “We already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.”In 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. “The idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,” the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was “actively working” towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. “We are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,” Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore — the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.

The Indian pharmaceutical and healthcare industry has long been dominated by men, a trait it shares with many of its counterparts abroad. But now a big change is sweeping across this immensely technical and challenging business landscape. A new crop of women business leaders has emerged at the top, coming up with game-changing ideas and services in some of India's top pharma and healthcare companies. Their business acumen apart, these women have added tremendous value in shaping their organisations.
 
 They are reinventing age-old practices and promoting diversity to meet challenges and take their companies to the top. Some like Ameera Shah of Metropolis have built the business from scratch while others like Samina Vaziralli of Cipla have been handed the reins of a 75-year-old company. But whether it is building businesses or wading through troubled waters, they have proved their mettle. They are young, but have come of age quickly. They are not afraid of taking business risks or foraying into newer businesses. They have embedded a culture of inclusive environment and pushed for HR reforms targetted at women in the DNA of their companies — who better than them to understand the struggles of juggling family and business. These are their stories.
 
 Our systems have kept pace with growth: Namita Thapar 39 CFO, Emcure Pharmaceuticals
 Key Accomplishment: Expanding global footprint and making five global acquisitions in the past 3-4 year
 Key Challenge: Managing work-life balance. Having to earn the respect from peers who judge her as someone born with a silver spoon 
 
 In 2006, five years after she completed her MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Namita Thapar got a call from her father Satish Mehta, promoter and CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, to join the family business in Pune. Thapar, a CA by qualification was then working in the healthcare sector in the US — for Glaxo and Guidant (now Abbott) in various finance roles. Emcure had by then received funding from private equity fund Blackstone and had aggressive plans to enter the US market. Mehta felt that with his daughter's US education and experience in the healthcare sector would add value to the business. He persuaded her and her husband to move back to India.
 
 The move paid off. Emcure is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India on account of launch of innovative formulations developed by its R&D and marketing strategies designed to build brands. In the last 10 years, it has grown from a Rs 500 crore company to a Rs 4,500 crore entity. ""I can't take all the credit as my brother Samit and husband Vik have added tremendous value too, but believe I have made some good changes based on my experience in the US. All three of us got a lot of autonomy from my father to make changes,"" says Thapar.
 
 Emcure has made five large global acquisitions in the past three years. As CFO, Thapar and her team assisted the M&A team in those deals. ""These strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded our global footprint,"" says Thapar.
 
 At Emcure, Thapar has brought more automation in finance, was closely involved with domestic marketing and helped make meetings more data driven (especially through sales force automation). She also worked with HR to improve critical systems such as appraisal, variable compensation and talent identification. ""I am a strong believer that as a company scales, it needs to become more process driven and develop leadership bandwidth,"" she adds.
 
 Thapar says there are plenty of reasons for more women to join the pharma sector. Functions like quality, finance, marketing, IT, regulatory are great areas for women to work, according to her.
 
 She has launched a program called ""Prerna"" aimed at increasing the representation of women in the company, which has doubled to 20 per cent in the past four years. Emcure has several women in leadership roles in quality, regulatory, marketing, IT, HR and finance, says Thapar.

206,3ewrql,Should I get an MBA? [NP],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ewrql/should_i_get_an_mba_np/,Finance/Business,"Currently, I am a undergrad student majoring in Finance in Thailand. I will be done in December. I haven’t done 10+2 –> only did the IGCSEs. My dad runs a jewellery business which I will join if I do not go for Masters. I have no prior knowledge about the business and I will move to India to train myself (it has been taken care of).

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions. ",9," I think your best option would be to opt for an MBA overseas.  If you want to expand your business, work with your dad and join an entrepreneur/Family Business oriented MBA/PGP program. For example, ISB has one http://www.isb.edu/management-programme-for-family-business.

 IMHO, you should go ahead with the MBA. Reasons:

1. It would give you the skillset and network needed to successfully run your dad's business, esp considering that you do not have work ex so far.

2. Even if you plan to stick with finance with the CFA, the MBA will still be a value add as it is highly regarded in finance companies.

A word of advice: Aim high, don't compromise on college because of the high fees. It's not like undergrad, where you can sit in your room at night and catch up on studies even if your profs are no good. In an MBA brand value and peer learning are important. Plus a top tier programme will provide enough return on investment to justify taking an education loan. Instead of CFA or MBA, why don't you try other finance courses too? You can learn with industry experts at Imarticus Learning. They even have placement options, if that is something you are interested in. Visit their website: www.imarticus.org .. They also offer online courses in case you want that flexibility.",4,0.68,1438126970.0

Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services. Photo: Reuters

Mumbai: The Mahindra Group and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will co-develop a blockchain solution, which the companies claim, has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.

This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement.

The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.

Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. The solution aims to simplify supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes that have historically been difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers.

Anish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group, said the group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth.

The company is also actively looking at other applications across the group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,” said Shah.

Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.

“Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did,” said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services.

The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, “and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,” he said.

In an interview with Mint in June 2016, Shah said Mahindra is sharpening its focus on digital technologies such as blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), to boost growth.

>She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight. Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Sindhu's career, a correspondent with *The Hindu* wrote:  
>  
>*""The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, travelling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment.""*

Proud of her, she deserves it ❤️ Yesss,This is huge considering she had lost in her previous two final appearances.
  
This is also a ruthless revenge for her narrow loss in the final against Okuhara in 2017 since she beat her in only 38 minutes! bless you, Sindhu. Wonderful effort by Sindhu! Hats off to Pullela Gopichand as well! Awesome she absolutely dominated Okuhara. 21-7 21-7 wow  thumping victory

Edit: (7:00PM) You can still watch the match on hotstar. starts at 2:23:00 mark 

https://www.hotstar.com/sports/badminton/final-okuhara-vs-sindhu/1440001984 Also B. Sai Praneeth won the Bronze medal in Men's singles category. Two medals in a single tournament. Thank you for making India proud Sindhu! She's a true national treasure This was one of the most one sided final I have ever seen. *Akshay Kumar has entered the chat* Amazing. Really proud of her This was sheer perseverance that finally paid off. Congratulations and this has to be one of the proudest moments of not only her life, but Indian sports as a whole. Not to forget, she dedicated this medal to her mother. It was her birthday today. Best gift ever. Congratulations!

As per the buzz Akshay is going to make movie out of this. He will act as Gopichand. Yay !! Sindhu 😍 Congratulations, golden girl. Truly dominant on court. Hope this erases the idea that she always falls one short from people's minds. Goodminton 21-7, 21-7

That's pure dominance! 

This one medal was evading her for so long, In 2013, 2014 she won Bronze, 2017, 2018 she won Silver but 2019 she made sure to clinch nothing but Gold...Brilliant and resilient stuff! 👏 [deleted] Her Quarterfinal round with Tai Tzu Ying was a hard fought win, she lost the first round, but went on to beat her in the next 2 to move to Semis. The last 2 sets were pretty close scores too.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcIcCyS-quU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcIcCyS-quU)

Compared to that she had fun at Semis and Finals. Kudos to the World Champion

Quite surprised by the one sided score line against Okuhara. P V Sindhu <3 <3 She is gonna inspire a whole new generation, for sure. So proud of her.... to lose two finals but then win her third final and that too in such emphatic fashion. No words can describe her achievement. Champ🙌 Really a proud moment for the nation. This needs more coverage. Girl power in India ! Heartiest congratulations to this strong and magnificent lady! She's doing us real proud! Proud feeling for her 👍 Did Carolina Marin play? Congratulations to p v sindhu for making india proud . Congratulations Sindhu. 

Has Kangana or Akshay announced a movie already? Aye haye. Boht khush kita. Sohni kudi. Set 1 = 21-7

P1V1=P2V2 ? Tight slap on the face of people who called her a chocker!! Modi 😎 hai 🤙 toh 👐 mumkin hai 👌.

Edit: /s -_- Cricketers can go suck a.... Not sure why we guys are so good at individual sports but terrible at team sports. And before you come at me, Cricket (a game) can't be counted as a team sport.

Congrats to Sindhu nevertheless.

EDIT: Thanks for the downboats. Forgot I was in /r/india. You guys can defend it all you like, only 12(?) fucking Commonwealth countries play the 'sport'. Last I heard, there was a commonwealth island where the WC (yes, world cup) players were carpenters...lol #THIS IS AN AD Easier to win over okhuhara at world championship than beating her at Olympics .",3430,0.98,1566765676.0
211,cvxqea,India’s Sumit Nagal took down Roger Federer 6-4 in the first set!! Yay!!,https://i.redd.it/yp1w5yi7ewi31.jpg,Sports,,95," 1-1 after two sets but really happy to see an Indian playing singles in the main draw. I remember the French open match between Somdev Devvarman and Nadal 7-8 years ago.

The first two sets were really close but Nadal just upped his game and sailed through.

Damn, what happened to that guy. He showed a lot of promise. It’s an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.
Let’s see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! 

All aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow. damn, Federer really showed him why he's the greatest. Props to Nagal for downing him one set out of four, though! Second set not looking good so far :( Google doesn't even have his pic Is there a live stream? Where can I watch this? Roger Federer won in the end. But Sumit Nagal showed if players like him are given more opportunities they can really defeat the biggest players in the town. Some good shots by the lad. A lot of credit goes to Virat Kohli... 

Confused? 

Virat Kohli Foundation has been helping and inspiring the youth of our country to follow their passion and dreams. They facilitate in providing the much needed help in preparing people like Sumit to scale at tremendous heights.., First Sindhu then this guy. 4-6,6-1,6-2,6-4 final score fyi Sorry, this feels like Ironman versus Thanos.

Can half imagine Fed say in Swiss accent, ""All this for a drop of blood....""

Well played buddy! The guy has the talent, great winner there! Nangal Dam!!!! Headbutting the  Grandmaster himself. Big deal. 

Great Job Sumit Nagal Damn federer is getting his ass kicked left and right last year and this year I wish more people knew about how big a thing this is. There is always a Indian better thn you. Really amazing Performance,feel proud as an Indian. Madlad I am excited that an Indian just 22 years old is showing so much potential but it would have been more glorious if his coaching would have been in India. only nadal or djokovic can match fedrrer Great performance !  The P.V Sindhu Factor Is Strong Lol Does anyone in India care about table tennis anyway? Really proud of sumit!! I wish him all the best! Super Sumit Nagal or Sumit Nadal?????? :))) Holy crap, this is big. Excellent! This is amazing stuff. Way to go Nagal, damn proud you. Ye toh bas shuruvaat hai, keep up good job! It's true though.  We have the most people in the world that deficate outside and on the beaches.  We need to stop doing this.  The internet has brought it to the world.  Im in Bogotá Colombia and was hitting on a girl and we met like six times then one day in front of all my new friends she pulls some bs up on the computer and shows a YouTube video of us shitting on railroad tracks... Like 100 people walking out of their homes to poo.  Everyone laughed at me so I just left Wow, nice going Sumit! shit I'm watching this now! Kid's got heart! Holy shit balls! hum indians choti choti baaton mein khushiyan dhuoond hi lete hain. Supported by VK! A young guy struggling to keep up against a guy almost twice his age.

indians, celebrating mediocrity as always. All the big matches are fixed, they wanted to give some spotlight to an Indian so they let him win one set, but that's all they'll give. Oh great...

Original Post can be found on his Instagram handle : rathikrishna42 Is it really an incomplete end of the era? The man literally won everything there is to win in the game as captain, not even as just a player.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn’t do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it’s sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it’s due. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals. Not incomplete and no end either. 

As a batsman he has slowed down in terms of power hitting but Pandya/ Pant will take over that front (which they should have in the semifinals). He is still as good a batsman you'll get for No 4/ 5, still a fast runner and lighting quick behind the wicket. Like for Federer it's the outsiders who are waiting for the retirement non-stop.

It is Ravi Shastri we need to bid goodbye to and move on. Some people move on Am I the only one who read 'DHOR' 🙆 No its not incomplete. He gave us Worldcup, worldcup 20 20, champion trophies, he is the most successful Indian criket captain in History. He is complete, his era is complete. He will deserve farewell like Sachin whenever he want to retire Its not the end. He will still play in T20 WC. Sorry I read it as Dhor first r/DesignPorn Incomplete? Bro which world are you living in? Or do you have amnesia. He has won everything that had to be won in cricket. Only captain with T20 World Cup, 50 Over World Cup & Champions Trophy. Pardon my language but fuck you for your stupid creative. It's because of ungrateful people who call themselves fans just like you that these cricketers are put under so much pressure to always perform. What have you done in your own uneventful life? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever completed anything worthy for generations to come? You bro, are shit. There's little or no worth to your existence. I am no Dhoni fanboy but your creative is just dumb, tone deaf and utterly mistaken. Thoda jyada ho gaya [deleted] Wonderful creativity. *an era How you say incomplete Bar bar yaad mat dilao yr. Seriously guys there is no fairy tale ending in life. He got out doing what he did best and that is all that matters. People want everything to be a bollywood movie.

I have myself not been a huge fan of keeping him in the team for the past 6 months, but you have to be foolish to think his career is incomplete. Dhoni is not retiring.

He's not. Okay!? Out of the loop here. Can anyone tell me what exactly happened?

Basically you need to buy something that is waterproof ( so sweat doesn't affect it) and has a great fit so that it doesn't keep coming off when you run 

And sports earphones are designed with those in mind you can find a descent one for around 1500-2500 I bought these cheap $20 wireless earbuds from Aliexpress. They sound decent and won't come off while running.

You can go for Huawei Freelace. Not available in India; get it on AliExpress. Jaybird x4, nothing else comes close. Boat is something that i am proud of... within 3k you get good sound and great quality Some ₹1.5k cheapass from Amazon

Works fine. Wireless JBL by harman Buy a cheaper one, most of the in earphones get spoilt due to sweat, dirt and wax One Plus bullet earphones Boat rockerz 225 Try out the Artis earphones! Pixel earphones. All other earphones have a tendency to fall off. Go for true wireless ones.. lots of options under 4k... Mivi crossbeats , leaf, nurepublic

Just make sure your expectation is right. These dont have large batteries.. i use jlabs which i picked up from an overseas trip.. had the noise shots before.. the battry lasted 3 hrs..

So if ur running for longer or training for a full.. i would suggest spend some more and get a good battery life ones.. Galaxy buds. Mi airdots are down to 1K on aliexpress. Doubt you will find better TWS option the price range. Sony MDRXB510AS wired or jbl endurance run bt for wireless. Park me kaise sound quality bhai.

This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them.

If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets.

Let’s just say for arguments sake Indians are not genetically athletic however in a sample size of 1.3 billion people you are going to have very large statistical outliers (I also don’t think Indians are not genetically inferior especially north Indians) but why haven’t they been found. China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not “athletic” in a large sample size there will be elite athletes. So why haven’t they been found in India. China also wins the second most medals and have also produces players in basketball. I’m just curious why this is with the population size.,18," Since you compare with China, I will paste my comment from an earlier thread

> Chinese government spends $46 billion on sports, while our budget allocation in sports is around $0.5 billion.

India needs massive infrastructure to train and support its athletes. Getting Olympic medals is a long term strategy, you can't just wake up one day and hope to win a medal. Just look at Mr. Bindra and the amount of time and money he invested to win his gold medal. We need world's top coaches to train our elite athletes, which needs $$$. Culture and history: Not many role models and viable career pathways hence low base  . The cliche of a billion people is just that a cliche without substance . Very few young people engage in sports, for starters need encourage kids to play but many schools don't have playgrounds .So parents are worried about kids future and discourage  them China does not have 2 billion people, its population size is close to India at 1.3-1.5 billion, some countries have more registered professional athletes of certain sports despite having much smaller population than China and India. 

It comes down to the sport culture of a country, I'm guessing there are fewer registered athletes in India than Netherlands even, also check out the availability of sport facilities in India compared to other countries, I think it is also pretty low. 

Indians are not genetically inferior but I think religion is a great factor when it comes to nutrition, there are so many food taboos around in India that are stopping ordinary Indians from having balanced diet. This topic was discussed just yesterday. [This](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf) famous paper found a strong association between Olympics medal tally and GDP, population size, ""host country effect"" and ""Olympics-oriented investment"" like in Soviet Union and China. China's advantage over India is its strong economy (5 times India's GDP) and an obsessive investment in sports. Apart from the many reasons listed already it's also about the cultural apathy towards any sport which we do not already dominate in. That apathy translates to exceptional athletes with medals practically begging for food after retirement. Govt does not provide enough after care to retired athletes and they are left to fend for themselves.

Would you want your child to sacrifice education for say a chance at volleyball if you know that most players have no future after the fact? Cause Indians don’t give a fuck about anything except cricket. Kyuki pesa lgta hai Like in real life democratic political system and govt has utterly failed to provide infrastructure for sports , promote it and provide facilities and support athletes . Its a combination of genetics, culture and GDP. In all these factors, India has the worst possible state.

1. Genetics: Indians on average are shorter and fatter than all races (maybe except East Asians). There is a study which shows that for the same BMI, Indians add on more fat than any other race. Needless to say, absorbing more fat for the same BMI is not a recipe for athleticism. 

2. Culture: The diet is horrible. Full of carbs (processed nowadays) and almost no protein. Nothing to do with income either, rich people also have the bad mix of macro nutrients. No culture of physical fitness. People think going to gym is only for bodybuilders.

3. GDP: $2000 per capita is 142 out of 200 countries. India is piss poor. Dont consider PPP here, top class sports equipment doesnt cost less in India. Small schools in the US have better facilities than elite sports clubs in India.

226,br9cdx,Why Hotstar Premium sucks. [np],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/br9cdx/why_hotstar_premium_sucks_np/,Sports,"1\. *They only do good quality 1080p for Game of Thrones.*

Literally every other show, movie and documentary (with very few exceptions) has a 1080p bitrate of less than 6Mbps. Game of Thrones, meanwhile, is at 9.2Mbps, which is almost twice as heavy in terms of bitrate than other HBO titles. Even Chernobyl, a lot of which happens in the dark, has a bitrate of 5.7Mbps.

Now, 4–6Mbps isn't necessarily a bad 1080p bitrate, especially if you are a service like Netflix that knows exactly how to encode video with that kind of a limitation.

But Hotstar is no Netflix, and their encoding is not very good. 

2\. *Content is censored and/or mutilated*

Iron Man 2 is censored (and I'm not just talking about the bleeps in the Senate hearing). Like, Star World on TV level censored. Oh, and it suffers from the low-ass bitrate too. 

3\. *Omnipresent logo on top right*

Why the hell does Hotstar think it is important enough to interrupt my viewing experience with their intrusive-ass logo? What does this achieve? Their DRM is already super-annoyingly world-class (probably thanks to third party firms paid off by HBO and the like). 

And if you watch a livestream, like GoT or IPL, you are forced to see both this logo as well as the Hotstar icon on the bottom right. 

4\. *Not accessible*

Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has closed captioning. Fuck deaf people. Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has an audio description track, even if one exists for the title (eg. Hollywood/HBO). To be fair, this shortcoming applies to every Indian streaming service. Which makes no sense, since we have the second population of people with sensory impairments. 

5\. *DRM-ed to the balls*

New device? Sorry, you're requesting multiple streams at the same time. Android phone? Sorry, we cannot show you 1080p video. VPN? Don't even go there. 

6\. *All of this was preventable*

Video quality? Just have more versions of titles at a higher bitrate for people with good internet. Logo? It's not burned into the video, so just take it off. Inaccessible? Just ask rightsholders to also send subtitle files and audio description files. Make DRM just as unintrusive as other streaming services that do business with the exact same group of companies you do. Censoring? Don't fucking do it. As simple as that. Two or three jobless lawsuits are nothing for The Mouse to handle.",112," That watermarked horrible logo along with poor bitrates on videos are the top most reasons I mostly pirate the shows I watch that's on hotstar exclusively, despite being a premium subscriber. You would be better off with HBO GO and a decent VPN. You forgot to mention if you want to skip to the next episode, you have to go through the closing credits and then the screen will change. Then you have to play the episode, select subtitles and then again fast forward the opening credits. Downloaded episodes on phone expire in a day. Shitty user interface. Netflix cost 600/month. Hotstar has PL for 999/year. 

Cheap> Quality. Especially for people like me who has hardly any time to watch anything. And you forgot about the search engine of hotstar. It's literally terrible. Also no 5.1 surround sound support. Yes but for ₹999/year I won’t complain I am yet to create an account and subscribe myself onto any of the streaming services and thus, I don't have an idea about the quality and content of each streaming services but, we won't be having Disney + here right?

As in most (if not all) those Disney + shows will be hosted by Hotstar here in India? Also, Hotstar is the one that has the entire MCU library, if I'm not mistaken? For 999/year includes IPL and English Premier League. It is a STEAL for sports fans.. To think I paid ₹999 for this garbage of a season You left out the shitty user interface. Long live psarips.net I am watching Chernobyl and the quality is utter shit. Can't believe I am paying for this shit. It sucks. I saw Chernobyl ep03 tonight and despite choosing 'high' quality, the video was worse than what Netflix data-saver option would be. I mean I'm happy to pay more to have the kind of viewing experience that Chernobyl can offer but Hotstar kills it.

Also, shit goes down way too often on the Hotstar app on my TV. Log in Hotstar - 'sorry something went wrong' error Wait till the content on HS get regulated/censored. 

Premium subscriptions for HS will soon die and they will be clueless , just like they are now. They got subtitles mate. Ah, thank you for reminding. Cancelling my subscription right now 😅. GOT over , Game over lol . I tried Hotstar Premium when there was some cash back offer and then promptly canceled it. I reached out to [hello@hotstar.com](mailto:hello@hotstar.com) on some of the points mentioned in this post with suggestions and feedback, but just got some boilerplate reply. I refuse to pay for this kind of service. Cheaper pricing isn't enough if the experience is terrible. In comparison, Netflix is several years ahead. The Hotstar product managers seem to be inept, and tend to think like they're just re-doing cable TV over the web. 🙄 You shouldn't bother with streaming services anymore if you can help it. Sooner or later, they will end up being censored to confirm to our ""Indian standards"" and most media on them will be ruined.

I don’t think they will ever improve the service, specially with the condescending attitude that they have. They have a very questionable design/architecture which results in fire fighting during every major event(GoT/IPL).

>Arthi Arun: I'm waiting for sponsors, till now no one approached me. I don't know why people ask me 'You're a doctor why do you need a sponsor?' Do you ask that to a cricketer? Sportspersons should be encouraged by giving sponsors so they concentrate on game&not financial burden. All the sports in India other than cricket deal with this because neither they are televised nor they are reported enough. Sponsorship depends upon popularity of sport which is very rare for weightlifting. You know every player's name of a cricket team but not the same with archery or any other sport. And to be real Sports Authority of India suck's the biggest! Well the sports authorities are busy attending the cricket World Cup so rest all sorts can wait. When participating in international events, is it possible to represent a neutral faction/body, instead of your own country?

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time 😅 Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

It was more nuanced than that . Sadly Hasan Took the easy way out and decried it as racism. Man that interview with Lalit Modi ( another Modi ha ha ) was funny af The episode is fine. But tbh he doesn't stress enough on the fact that why BCCI  does what it does. India being the most populous cricket playing nation, generates the most revenue. Naturally it would want the major chunk of it so that it could be used to distribute to the state cricket boards. This would only help in improving the facilities in the country. It might not be the most morally right thing to do but it also is not that wrong. It is a classic capitalist move. This is classic american mentality when they bully instituations for thier countries bennifits..its justified.. 

But when others do it it's curruption...

BCCI bully ICC becuase we supply major chunk of thier revenue. India gives cricketers arround the world opportunity and money. So ya BCCI have every right to be selfish and use thier leverage. BCCI use that money to improve stadiums and give more opportunities to young players.

I am not going to deny that BCCI doesn't have internal corruption but its no where near the level of past.. and after all the scandals in recent past BCCI has realised that its in thier best interest to stay out of politics... so i see no reason to be angry towards BCCI now. Just another recent case.. Australia and England were allowed to withdraw their players from the IPL for world cup prep. South Africa also wanted to do the same, but India blackmailed them with the cancelation of a tour after world cup. The big three at work again!

Ps. This is only a rumour and very few articles came out. But Ottis Gibson (coach of RSA) publicly said ""It would have been great had our players came back earlier"" and there were commentators who were talking about it at times too. But yeah, it is totally plausible. Does anyone else find him annoying? Ah yeah let me comment on others house made of glass while I sit in my comfort zone inside a well built fenced house.
I will only identify myself as an Indian while playing the victim card. 
Just sayin. I stopped watching IPL a few years ago as it became too many matches for me to care. Glad I did. Even FIFA is more interesting with all their scandals as it happens once every few years instead of every year! Is it bad that I feel proud when he says ""BCCI made ICC it's bitch."" If BCCI is bringing in this amount of Insane money where is it actually going? I am the only one who is seeing the symbolism in his hoodie choice for the episode. [removed]",127,0.87,1558957200.0

234,bwkqxu,Your thoughts on e-sports,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,Sports,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",48," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental.

Dude is an honorary army man, supports the army... What's wrong with that? It's just gloves. Trivial bullshit is trivial. I don't mind them asking Dhoni to remove the insignia as long as they don't entertain any other political gestures from anyone else. But the problem is far too many have gotten away with it. Enforce the rule strictly and consistently. Otherwise, their request carries no weight. How does it hurt ? Wtf ? Tributes are done everywhere , I get rules are rules. 
How does cosmetic change affect the game ? 

Can somebody enlighten me ? Yeah they have a point. Dhoni should instead go at the border and fight instead of playing sports if he can't part with indian armies even while playing. Good. request ? he should be fined. whats with request ? if he violated the rules..he should be fined. Social Media is making this matter more highlighted. There are some rules & regulations of ICC which should be followed by the cricket playing nations.

Both BCCI & ICC can make the decision by going a step back. Isko bhi PTSD de bhagwan. Aur gloves pahene se nhi hoga.",77,0.89,1559865620.0

My name Is Nicklas I come from Denmark, but that's irrelevant. I’m doing some research on Abhinav Bindra - possibly for a video biography.

&#x200B;

I am here because I want to know how big of an influence Abhinav Bindra has had (and possibly still has?) on India. How did his Olympic gold medal in 2008 impact the country? I’ve read his book, but I want to hear some personal accounts and experiences. How could the everyday Indian feel the impact of this event - if any? Was it celebrated nationwide? How did it impact the culture? Did anything change? How significant was this day in 2008 - and the man?

&#x200B;

Any and all comments are welcome! Thank you!!",8," Nothing changed for other sports, shooting is for the elite and well connected. The laws in India prevent any common man in India to get into shooting. For example the purchase of an airgun requires you to be first a member of a shooting club, these clubs don't entertain applications unless you know someone or bribe them to give you membership, these people are fucking corrupt as hell and will treat you like a piece of shit unless you are well connected.  Purchase of a fire arm is next to impossible for the common man. They will never give you a firearm license if you say you want it for sport. Majority of the indian shooters come from law-enforcement and military community. 

This sport is for the upper elite, there is no grassroot sport shooting revolution, may be there are more rich shooters now. I think the Olympic gold did capture public attention. Coupled with India hosting Commonwealth games just after it, and doing well there, there has been more attention to Olympic sports. Of course, the attention isn't very detailed and sports ministry still lacks significant accountability mechanisms, but I feel there is more interest in Olympic sport athletes. I was a kid back then: so don't know much 🙄",22,0.96,1562272551.0
238,c55wl5,Is cricket really that popular outside India?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c55wl5/is_cricket_really_that_popular_outside_india/,Sports,"I mean, the main issue I see with ODI cricket its just a big test of patience at times. Unlike any huge game, like soccer, rugby, baseball, hockey, etc. Cricket is just too too long.   
   
I loved ODIs during my childhood but nowadays I just can't help but say that IPL is infinitely more exciting than ODIs.    
  
Is cricket locally as popular in any other country? Except India or the subcontinent? I mean there are teams from plenty countries, but is cricket actually popular in the streets or base level there?",16," TLDR - No. 

Real answer - ICC isn’t really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it’ll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ’d in it 🤦‍♂️ I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become ""more South Asian"" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don’t bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.

And i believe the BCCI and ICC are responsible for it. Hasan Minhaj summaries it quite well in his [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM)",13,0.84,1561484466.0

Preferably, with a budget of not more than 3-4k ?",13," I don't think any reasonable shoe can last for years, nor is that something to be expected. They take the abuse, so your feet don't have to.

For example, walking shoes are expected to give out after about 700 kms, which should be about a year under regular use. Asics Gel Lyte would last you a long time. Also they're the best for running. Any sports shoe, at long as you don't use it. I have had Reebok, Puma and Fila.

All these have lasted for about 3 to 4yrs atleast. Never had an issue. ASICS Sketchers. They're costly but worth it imho very comfortable too. Been using one pair for about 2 years now.   
I like asics, or you can try Decathalone For general purpose, Puma shoes are good. For running nothing beats ASICS.",9,0.81,1567010073.0

Can you please give me any input on that?

Edit: I have already began my preparation, in a manner. I am reading Indian Express everyday, started reading Indian history and economics (finished 9th standard). Do you think hard work + smart work is enough to crack UPSC? Isn't there a lot of luck involved considering only around 300 general students get selected out of around 10k+ seriously studying for it. Do you feel you got lucky in the first attempt? Wow. Happy for you. Congratulations!  Do an AMA if possible. Please marry me? Also, congratulations.

My parents have been telling me stories of kids who cleared UPSC all day.

Seriously though, congratulations brother. Hey... Remember this day whenever you feel depressed or demotivated somewhere along your work. Remember that you have the power to help the needy, do the right thing and stand up against people who do our society bad.

Congratulations. Congrats and most important question.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Congrats Buddy! Dont become one of those 'file sign' sahib. Try to take initiatives and most importantly lower rank officers are one who are corrupted state civil officers/tehsildar etc...so maybe try to bring honesty in department. All the best we need more young officers like you. Proud OP, the score in written part is in my control, I get based on how well I write. Now coming to the interview, how does the panel look at candidates who didn't give up, like let's say I have been at civils for 4 years after my graduation, doesn't that create a bad impression as in the candidate should have done something else rather than putting eggs in one basket?  Ay my man Mark Antony Congratulations  Congratulations! I never thought the day will ever come when an Indian redditor gets to go inside the heart of the national 'system'. Kudos to you.

On a different note (Not trying to be a party pooper or anything),  I feel it's my duty to bring the following up. 

Now the reality of the country's governance, working for the smug senior bureaucrats, swallowing one's pride and principles at the orders of our unethical, poorly literate and absolutely ruthless political masters should hit you after your training.

Don't let these things get you down. Stick to your principles. You will learn to 'adapt' to the system ( but don't do it too much!). At all times, please remember Gandhiji's Talisman. That should make your dilemma easier.

Much respect and well wishes from a concerned citizen. Legalize marijuana when you get there Congratulations!!!!!


Now, How much are you gonna charge to get job done?  

 Well apparently not all of us randians are useless it seems lol...Btw congratulations on your success, I too aspire to join the services someday Congratulations! You're now in a position to make a difference. Don't shun your values and don't become corrupted. Congratulations to you!!

I have a decent public sector job and I am trying to clear one of the major exams of 2019. Wish me luck as well. I will hit you up this time around next year with my results. Saving your post for future communication ease. You give me inspiration. 

Also, congratulations are well in order! Please do not get corrupted and do not waste your time like Dipak Rawat raiding small businessmen.

""In India's parliamentary democracy, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the people's elected representatives—cabinet ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants, who serve at the pleasure of the President of India, to carry it out.""

I never understood the concept of working for minister who don't have a degree but want a professional who had cracked objective questions in seconds, penned downed his thoughts flawlessly on holycow and ofcourse his interview rounds.

Would love hear the real reason behind to go for civil services of India.

I am sure the one who has so much knowledge with degree can lay polices also. Clear this dilemma please. Noice Congratulations man

I hope this one feat. Makes you leave a mark of honesty and integrity in india
I love my country but at the same time the petty politics and sheer corruption at every end makes me feel like an alien

Happy Future of oppressing the poor and getting corrupted.  Congratulations 🎊  Congrats bro!!! Good to know that u are from general category 👍👍 (read a comment below) Many many congratulations mate! Just 2 Questions -

* At what age did you start preparation for UPSC?

* Did you take *any* coaching?

I'm an aspirant myself. Congratulations! No offence , but are you sc/st or OBC ? As they have quotas , it's easy for them. it is extremely sad to see that indians in 2019 have dreams of working for the indian government and see it as the pinnacle of achievement.

It is very, very sad to see that the oppressive Raj has been replaced with indian rulers. That the population is blind to this is even more discouraging. The incentives of the Raj are almost exactly the same as that of the indian bureaucrat: exploitation and self-enrichment. They have not changed one bit. There are honest people in the bureaucracy but they are few and far between.

It should give us pause that we are celebrating someone joining the single largest organisation responsible for the loot of the nation on a daily basis: the government and bureaucracy. So, what is so appealing in civil services? I am sorry guys, if this sounds offensive to the post. But, I have not been in my country for about 9 years now. And had I known that I can also give civil services and end up in a good position in India, I would have definitely tried. Again, please don’t think I am undermining anything that the OP has done. And, another question is, can this exam be given by a person of any age? Like me, I am 31. Can I also give this exam and get into a good position in India? Thanks for listening patiently guys. Again, I repeat, no offense to the original poster. Peace!

Happened to me once in Gurgaon. Two guys snatched a couple of pizzas from the delivery boy. He was very apologetic about it but I had to tell him not to worry. I don't expect him to fight with two burly guys over a fucking pizza. #justgurgaonthings :P Wtf? Is food order snatching a thing now? He's said it so calmly ,like this is a common thing that happens every now and then [removed] ""... delivery agent has *confirmed* that somebody snatched the order..""

He had to check twice to make sure they just wouldn't run around the block and give it back :D

It's pretty hilarious but I guess it's also worth noting that it's dangerous to be a food delivery person at 12:00am.

Edit: Fix Quote and typos This is hilarious ! The next time make sure to snatch the order yourself. :D FIR file kro. Cctv recordings check kro. We live in a society OP is ordering at 1230 am with 9% battery . Bad luck indeed ! Not sure if reddiquette is the appropriate tag here. Were you expecting to kickstart a conversation on prevalence of forcible dispossession of packaged sustenance from mobile vehicle-mounted agents in Indian urban spheres?

It all makes sense now r/uselessgreencircle Which city? Pretty common occurrence where I live in Gurgaon.. :/ r/wellthatsucks Man..! I need to keep an eye on my lunch box. Wow that's crazy This is apparently very common. There are 'black zones' in every city where such things happen. Delivery guys get kidnapped into the house, their wallets and food stolen and they are beaten before they are let go. Not sure if police cases get filed in such cases.

1. How do you perceive the Law and Order situation to evolve over the short term?

2. What are your expectations regarding returning to Kashmir?

3. Do you wish to return back to your ancestral house?

4. Would you be willing to pay back all the facilities that have been provided to you by the government for the past 30 years? For example, would you be willing to give up the housing that you got if you get your old house back?

5. Should reservation for Kashmiri Pandits be withdrawn now?",74," I know one but he's 20. I'll try to contact his father. One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don't think he's on Reddit

His entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don't talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: 

""Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don't know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn't change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.""

Also he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read ""Our moon has blood clots"" I foresee the situation to worsen in Kashmir while it will get better in Jammu and Ladakh. This will predominantly be because of separatists and other locals who might have been rendered slightly powerless. There is a reason why PM sent more armed forces into the state.
As for my return, i can list out a few reasons why i do not want to return:
1. Highly volatile atmosphere with frequent disruptions due to militancy, army. 
2. Not many opportunities work wise
3. Presence of radical islamists and separatists in the valley makes me believe that it’s very easy for 1990 to repeat itself . There is a reason why extra army is present in Kashmir at the moment
4. sold off the only house we had in Srinagar for peanuts after finally giving up the idea of returning. Some of my cousins’ houses were burnt down or squatters simply moved in. In short, there is no neighborhood I can think of returning to.
5. Younger cousins and the generation after has grown up outside of Kashmir with only language or food binding them to Kashmir. No point thrusting them into this chaos. 

Your question #4 does not make sense at all. How can you quantify someone’s loss that too after 30 years? Keep in mind, people did not only lose house or property, but whole lives were uprooted. The community has nearly lost its identity outside of JK and will essentially be non existent with in next 50 -100 years. Can you put a $ figure on it?

I am also not sure what reservations are you referring to in question #5. Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  
I will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :

""I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch."" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I'm 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I'm not in the best position to answer OP's questions but I can take a stab if they're still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone's interested:

My parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven't been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it's like about 15 years ago. And it's sad and terrible. But, it's possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what's happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. 

Unfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it's fucking saddening. What's worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of ""patriotism"" and ""unification"" (perhaps I'm projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don't think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. 

The most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it's just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it's the common person who's affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world's most militarized zone. I'm extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we're living through the creation of another West Bank here. I am a Kashmiri Pandit, I turn 30 in a few months. I know many Kashmir Pandits over 30, including my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.

1. I am of the opinion that Kashmir will be violent in the short term. Extremist violence is common in Kashmir, why should this situation be any different?
2. We will never return to Kashmir, outside of the occasional very short trip. I have been to Kashmir once in my life, despite my father begging me not to go, for my safety. I had to see the place that haunts my entire family, at least once. My father has been back once since the 1980s. The handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off. 
3. Our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile. Our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell, under threat of violence. The bones still exist, but it was turned into a shopping mall. We won't return because we'll never feel safe. 
4. My family was not provided housing by the government of India. We were privileged enough to pay for our own housing. Many family members settled in the Delhi area and have done well for themselves since. Some family members  have moved to the US, Dubai, Singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves. I know that my family is not the kind of Pandit you're asking the question about, but it is true that the Kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of Kashmir. Of course, those who are still refugees are different, but come on - Kashmri Pandits who have a modicum of success aren't moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment. 
5. Yes. The reservation was an ill-intentioned policy that failed Kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of Kashmir with India.

I am by no means a Hindu nationalist and I think the Indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in Kashmir as well as the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (as does the Pakistini government, and Kashmiri Muslims).

Frankly, I think Kashmiri Pandits are beside the point in this discussion, because Kashmiri Muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture. Without anchoring to the homeland, there aren't enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry non-Kashmiris. In a generation or two, Kashmiri Pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldn't consider ""our plight""

Policy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago, but now it's too late. Without internet and swarm of Bharat ke garam naujawan in reddit. I think I can see if no one turns up.

Also, what religion will you be teaching your children if at all you want to. Unless you plan to stay internationally you're bound to face huge problems in bringing her to India and her going back to Pakistan for visits etc.given the tense situation which can blow up anytime into a war like one.

How'd you plan to handle it? Congratulations! Punjaban, good luck man. What did her parents and relatives have to say about the arrangement? Congratulations man! God bless you both! Dating a Pakistani was fun when I was in London, but I wouldn’t have had the balls to marry one. Kudos!

Just remember one thing, even if you guys end up getting British citizenship, Indian govt for the purpose of immigration when you enter the country won’t allow her a visa on arrival that other Brit citizens are eligible for since she would be an ex-Pakistani citizen. 

However, that is atleast about 7 years away, so meanwhile she would be getting these short term visas. And by short term I’m talking in days and not months. Max my Pakistani friend who got married to an Indian from WB has gotten is 45 days. He is a  green card holder, she has American passport with PIO. 

Don’t let these small irritants deter you from celebrating the glory of your marriage. 

God bless you two again! Congrats!

251,bfrh0g,India's first indigenous processor developed at IIT Bombay. I am a designer AMA!!,https://i.redd.it/37dmt3wfnnt21.jpg,AMA,,622," Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.


There is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?

b. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?

c. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..

1. Which module(s) were you part of?

2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?

3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?

4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?

5. What was your preferred method for DFT?

6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?

7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?

8. Is this our own fab? I'm dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.

Thanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I'm a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this? Wasn't the 1st microprocessor developed by IIT Madras? Shakti.  How is it different from it & can it compete with Intel? Can we build a low cost Raspberry Pi/Arduino alternative with this chip? Or what kind of hardware specs are yet to be integrated in this for one to realise a functioning SBC for the DIY maker community. Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm really interested in the field of architecture.
Does this processor implement pipelining? Does it dispatch instructions in order or does it implement out of order dispatch/processing? Why not RISC? What is the design team size at IITB? I assume the final synthesis, verification, and layout was done in Cadence? How many design cycles did you need before taping out the final version? Sorry for too many questions! Once the final version is out into mass production, can we have a course like *NAND to Tetris*, where they try to teach us how an entire computer is built out of nand gate. 

Something like this for electronics(in this case the design) which will ease the fear and improve the understanding, of course this should come out in free time How much did it cost to develop this processor? Is this the same as developed in IIT Madras?? Which was fabricated for free at Oregon? Wow. This is amazing!!

I'm guessing this is based on open source hardware. Is the architecture of this cpu available to take a look at? Congratulations! Can you give a bit of a overview of what it is capable of? What kind of skills would i need to become a part of something like this? I'm currently doing my undergrad in ECE. Which subjects should i focus more on to develop the skills you have to make a chip like this? Hey,

While I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.

>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.

Untrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It's like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.

Bluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.

>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.

Mate, don't expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.

>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.

I don't know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)

Or that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU's? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)

Or that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)

The only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -

>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.

[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)

>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can't reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.

So then don't call it India's first indigenous processor. Call it India's first indigenous processor-design language and not India's **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.

Anyways, it doesn't matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments. If you call yourself an academician working at a prestigious place like IITB, you should put a bit more thought into your responses. Are you planning to do MBA from IIMA as well. What's the cost compared to an Intel/AMD processor? And clock speed? What was the most challenging part? Are you from electronics or CSE? As a cse student from another iit this sounds a great development and shows the amount of hard work you guys put in research. Congratulations!  
 
PS : hire me in next placement season What is the purpose of creating this processor? Do you see India as a competent nation Atleast in terms of necessary resources for setting international industrial standards for this chip in near future(10-15 years)?

Summing up,can we use these chips like the pic/Arm/Avr in anytime in future or is it too early to call a shot? Congrats! Any plans for a retail development board? What is the full form of AJIT? Will you employ americans to do your telephone support? What were your biggest challenges ? When was this accomplished? [Link to the detailed article](https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor)

P.S : Thanks to u/kash_if Congrats!

Are you going to release it publically? Like for use in phones and computers? Or is it going to be reserved for research purposes?

Also how is it better than currently used processors? i seem to be more interested in how did you get involved. i have similar ambitions. could you, please? How good is fabrication from SCL? Are you going to open source the instruction set, bootloader code, etc? Where can I download the RTL, is it there on opencores? Business Perspective: Will India be into processor fabrication, like how it is into IT services. Do we have required raw materials and the process to fabricate with cost lesser than importing one. I have a more general question. China is investing a lot in semiconductors in order to reduce chip imports. It also has companies like HiSilicon which is aiming for competing with the likes of Qualcomm. India is obviously not quite there yet but there have been voices calling for this for years.

How realistic should we be with our expectations? When could we see an Indian competitors to these kinds of companies? Do you think the state needs to step in the way it has in China with massive financial support or do you think the private sector can do it on its own with some collaboration with academia? Thanks. - Is the tech used on par with what other international makers are using? Where do we fall behind? 

- Why would a device maker use this processor instead of commercially available similar processors?

- How far is it from mass production? Will it even be mass produced or just remain a lab experiment?

- Why do you think are we so far behind in this space? Almost all developed countries have dozens of fab plants and India has just one? Why is govt. not investing in this industry, this industry alone could give a massive boost to the Indian economy? What instruction set? [deleted] 1)Does it require its own motherboard or is it compatible with commercial available mobo.                    
   2) How will you compare it with current gen CPU of Intel and AMD,like which processor will it be comparable to.             
               3)How much RAM it supoort How far is it from mass production? When could we see any company or you announcing real world products? I don't really have a question - just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team - hope this endeavor continues to even greater heights. Well done! Where is the technical documentation? Is this going to be an open core? That is so fucking cool. Kitna deti hai? I don’t know much about processors or about tech in India but it looks cool and you have my upvote We were told you were making this, in VJTI. One time Prof. Girish Kumar mentioned this too. Congratulations on its completion. 💜 Now we’ll have to call America for support Respect bro A wonderful achievement itself , I hope that we can see India producing microprocessors with the likes of Intel or AMD's flagship microprocessors at a cheap rate and paving the new generation of microprocessors for the betterment of technology and the country soon enough. Congrats, you've made us proud! Btech or Mtech Honest question: why have you started this AMA on a Sunday past midnight? fabrication ? 
10 nm ? x86, ARM or something new? Can it run Crysis? [deleted] Which Architecture dose it support and what is max data carrying and crunching capacity of this processor ? Where and by whom did you get the fabrication done?

Do you think we can get mobile phone manufacturers to set up high volume fabrication (not assembly, which are already in few places or will be) plants in India? 
Congratulations quite happy to see development of a processor in India 
Can you list the issues facing the semi conductor development and  fabrication sector in our country? like we do not have a single fab company That manufacturers of devices could use What is the distance between its transistors? How did you get into the process of creating it? How does it differ from other processors in terms of performance and efficiency? I am assuming there must be some caveats as this is a new project so can you please mention them. Specs details? Are you looking to make it an industry standard, if yes, what advantage does it have over intel or similar popular processors First of all many many congratulations..!! 
So what are the future plans? Only use it for the systems and applications you mentioned above? Or near future you have any commercialization plans for this processor to be used in PC's? How can i be involed in any manner in any kind of process within this project? . Damn keen on knowing/understanding this development. [deleted] Wasn't Shakti the first one?
How similar are the two?
Major applications? Could you please share what processor node this was based on? Is it market ready or still a kind of prototype? If it is market ready, what are the next plans for use of this mp? But the real question is, can you game with it? RISC based ? How is it compared to the currently available same type of processors? Thanks for the ama!
Some questions I have-

1. What tools did you use for apr? And does Iit bombay have good license support?

2. You mentioned you’re moving to 65, which fab would this be made by?

3. Does Scl supply any memory compilers?

4. How much of the chip was made in custom?

5. Why did you use vhdl instead of system verilog? Why have you named it Ajit man ? We already got a ""Ajit Pai"" meme, the dude who tried to destroy internet, now soon we will have Ajit processor meme's, why on Earth would you name a processor Ajit ? Why not something like Arjun, Drona, Bhishma, Ram, Shiv, Karna, Karma, Duryodhan, Ravan, Hanuman, Bajrang, Vayu, Trimorti, Bheem or anything else ? So this is different from the “Shakti” processor from IIT Madras? This looks really cool. What desktop processor does it compare to in terms of performance ? I have answered a lot of questions in a short while. I think I will come back after a bit. Please keep the questions coming I am really excited about upcoming questions. Where do plan to get it fabricated at 65nm? Is SCL starting fabrication at 65nm? Is Mass production of this going to happen in India or abroad? I read you said it'll be mass produced at an aim of 100rs but will that be possible to be done within in India? Does India have a leap-frog advantage of starting late in this field? Like the lack of credit cards was okay since we leap frogged to finance apps for credit Don't know much about processors but that looks gorgeous This is exicitng. 
Nano meter? Also do you think we'll be able to mass produce? If AJIT was comparable in performance and speed to a commercially available processor that was made in the past, which one would you equate it to? Any reason behind the name AJIT ?  
Also, congrats and good luck What incentive do businesses have to design their products using this processor? Does it require external cooling? Or is the IHS enough to cool this processor? What kind of power consumption can it handle? Also does What kind of TDP applies to it. You've made so proud and happy OP we need more of you. How complicated is the manufacturing for this processor? Process node? Are there any public papers on how their transistor performance compares to competitors ? What are some pros and cons from x86 and Arm Congratulations :D How commercially viable is this processor. When ARM, Intel and AMD are flooded the market. Do you have any plans to sell Dev kits like raspberry pi? What exactly has been built from ground up? Is it the ISA? Is is the underlying VLSI? Is the actual fab done in India? Can it make me a sandwich? What next? It's 2019 ffs. Congratulations OP. You guys have accomplished a enormous task. I am proud of you people. Some questions if you don't mind.

1-Are guys planning to release an SoC of this.?
2-Is there 64 bit or further in the future?
3-How many no of transistors does it have?
4-Is it able to run the Linux Kernel?
5-What was the most challenging part in the design of the AJIT? Why didn’t we make it any time sooner? What were the challenges that stopped us from making this processor in earlier decades?
There are some really famous and efficient processors readily available in the market at affordable price. Are you planning to get this project to that level or is it only for research purposes. Compare it with something like ARM7 / ARM M4 ? I’ve installed a chip like that by hand. Hand formed, hand soldered. This is a remarkable feat but this causes a brief flashback. Aside from the awesome technical accomplishment,  I must also acknowledge the pleasing aesthetic of your product.

Congratulations! Hey great work indeed. How big are the dimensions of current processor? I’ll buy a development board if there ever is one available! Does it have a built in serial UART? Where did you copy-pasted the design? You just made my point Could you tell us the specifications? Transistor size, density, etc. What level of clean room is available to you? 100? Techniques used for lithography and masks.

I'm also intrigued by the code to hardware thing. I'd guess specialized hardware runs orders of magnitude faster as opposed to generalized ones. 

Would it be possible to make a chip for a particular time consuming program(say photo shop or matlab) making it much cheaper hardware wise if you wish to use it for a singular purpose. Making it sort of cartridges like which used to be case with nes video games making it impossible to pirate a software.

Also most of the specialized machines (SEM, TEM) we have run on way old computer software e.g. 95 and 98 as they don't invest in drivers for newer version of windows. Would it be possible to replace the controller of these machines with a single use computer.

Also is anyone working on quantum computing? People are trying to build it up from scratch so wouldn't it be better if we could jump on it. More like mobile revolution happened in India skipping the landline revolution. OP can you suggest me some resources on 8086. IWTL I have a genuine doubt about something being called 'indigenous'. What does it really mean? hope this captures diy market and helps developing prototype projects quickly Congratulations on your success. Even though i dont know anything about computers. But this looks interesting. Well done! Could this guy run Linux? What sort of I/O does it provide? (Ethernet, GPIO, I2C, etc) where is it manufactured?? Btw great job.  What’s with the name? Any chances for a cooler name that appeals to the millennials? Why the naming? It sucks so bad.. get a ambitious name atleast. First of all congratulations! Its great achievement.

Does it have its own Instruction set? Is it RISC or CISC? How come only a few newspapers and reddit will celebrate these achievements which come out of IITs and IISc ? This is awesome. Congrats. But, since you mentioned the “future,” I am wondering if you and your team are ready to bypass all patents for chip manufacturing. Eg. developed patentable creative way of developing it without interfering prior arts. 

I wonder why military can’t use foreign chipsets; maybe reverse engineering to make sure it does what it does would be sufficient enough and cost effective. How many masks were needed to fabricate this? How long will it take to launch it to market
And what more improvements are we looking at? can you please state the specs Is there a reference manual and a compiler?

What are the advantages of developing own microprocessor compared to picking up an ARM reference architecture and customizing it for your own requirements? How much cooling does it require? Is it passively cooled? Asking since the clock speed isn't something in Ghz.

&#x200B;

What kind of motherboard or accessories does it require to work? What about things such as RAM and other hardware controllers like storage or other things? (sorry if question isn't clear I'm not much of a Chip guy lol.) any chance of a micro controller/processor like arduino/rspbpi? with peripherals? Congrats! How long did the whole project take to reach up to this prototype? What's the power consumption of this prototype?

How do you come up with the Rs 100 estimate of mass produced cost?

What's the minimum feature size/technology node of the fab process for Ajit?

Do the power consumption and performance meet the envisioned use case for satellite deployment? Hiya OP, I'm glad you guys have done this, it's quite something, do you plan on building anything in the future for desktop grade architecture? Cheers! what is the ISA for this processor? are there any benchmarks? what architecture was used to produce this RISC or CISC..?? Yay Considering the many processors that are currently in the market, could you please tell us how this compares or rather how this is better? Could you also lay the difference in cost when comparing with other processors in the same category?

Now that this was fabricated in India where do you see the future of of microprocessor fabrication in our country?

EDIT: how would this compare to an ARM, raspberrypi and so on? Can we expect this to be commercially available for home projects? Can it run minesweeper What will be the benchmark processor if we wish to compare with other popular ones. ? Will this be commercialized, and actually be able to compete with processors by other big companies? Cost less than rs100 if produced on a mass scale? How much does a processor of same specs cost in the market? What is the assumed profit margin to your product? Does it work? What educational background do I need to join your team? Reading through all the comments and sub-comments, I can't help but wonder that this AMA is a supreme example of how an AMA should be. [deleted] Hi there,

I have a couple of questions (3 infact)

1. Why do we not have our own indigenous processors that compete with the likes of Giants like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Exynos or Kirin? I mean its been so long, we have some greatest brains in our country.
2. Not offending anyone, but we could have probably reverse engineered the process or taken help from engineers who have previously worked for these companies. Why do we have to start from scratch? Why start from Mhz? Why not directly Ghz? (atleast 1 Ghz would be good. Enthusiasts would probably buy this instead of the Raspberry Pi and provide some funding to the research)
3. At this rate, how long do you think will it take to reach a competitive level in terms of the ""nm"" tech.? (Please don't say near future) Which programmable chip (I am assuming some FPGA) did you use for testing AJIT? I will try a HPC around it. Xilinx devkits are really good at combining softcores and provide an on-board ARM processor to build a complete embedded system where you can accelerate hardware and use ARM's existing computational capabilities. 1. How long did it take to complete the entire ASIC flow? 
2. Is there a spec sheet available? Im all in for indigenous technology..But don't you think we are bit too late in the processor making race. Even mobile processors have achieved GHz capacity with half a dozen parallel cores with integrated peripherals. Even if we catch up with the big players in the market, we will still need to build the ecosystem around it, do you think we can do that ? 

I agree this is just a start, we can use low frequency processors in a lot of military, industrial and household equipments - microwaves, washing machines, are you guys looking at a niche within that or is it going to be some heavy computing in future?

And, i kinda feel that government wants to make headlines with this, every government in india does that, how is their support in the long term ? 

Also, this is a very huge opportunity, it feels great to be a part of something this big. How is the diversity in the public institutions that support this kind of leg room in technological research ? Kudos Brother / Sister. :) Hearty congratulations on your Achievements

Brutal Question
Do you plan to implement a secret CPU running inside the processor which has complete remote access, similar to Intel's **Management Engine** or AMD's **TrustZone**?

If not how would you takle pressure from government authorities in case it is mandated. Benchmarks pls Reading AJIT on that chip triggers me because of AJIT PAI. 

Nonetheless, Kudos for this achievement OP and his team. Can it run crysis? Hi, I am so interested in designing microchips and processors. Being part of a team that develops such products is so awesome! I am currently on my way to enter Mtech VLSI in one of the NITs. Can you suggest some essential tools/skills that'll help me to get into such industry? I am from electronics background and circuits have always fascinated me. Wrong, IIT Madras developed 'SHAKTI' processor in Nov 2018 Looks like arc reactor from Ironman 2 (it's square instead of triangle). One question though, how is it different from other processors in the market (despite it would be produced in India) and are we planning to mass produce it here? And congratulations, this marks a success!! I initially thought, it was a carom board. Well done! When will it be mass produced? So you started from wafer level? How did you get all the etching done? That's a very nice and insanely costly thing to have to just make one chip, isn't it? Any plans to build GPUs? u/prabot kudos on the success. I had a query. What is the socket/pin description for AJIT? Wasn't Shakti the first one???
Please correct me if I'm wrong. How many nanometers? Can it compete with STM 32? What architecture is it? Is it a new one? Comparable with STM 32? Architecture? Btw wasn't riscv based shakti released before your processor? All I see is that you're going for the embedded market, but every story I read describes the AJIT as a microprocessor. Are you planning on making a microcontroller with this architecture or is it meant to be a processor only?

I mean a 32bit 100MHz uC for approx 2usd would be sweet, although I don't, from a marketability standpoint, understand why you went with the sparc v8. I guess licensing ARM would render the chip too expensive.

I'm going to stick with AVR and ARM for now, but I wish you good luck with the AJIT. Does it do the needful? PAPA ne nahin bola sharma ji ka beta is in Intel making 10nm processors /s Show bobs and vagna RISC V ARCH I Guess ? what does it run?, what architecture is this? , what's the benchmark? 
any link to such details would be appreciated.

Nice work though. Will there be any requirement of operating system / kernel developer ? 
What will be Applications ? I'm really intersted in learning this stuff (designing processors / how processors work) do you have any book recommendations? But can it run Crisis? Do you hope to rival other processor manufacturers such as intel and AMD in their processing power? Or aiming to excel above their standards? Would you say that the price would be similar or cheaper? And final question, would you also manufacture a cooling system that best suits this new processor that is both light weight and highly efficient? If so you got my complete support! Is nanotechnology a buzzword or will it make an impact? Thank you for sharing this!  Just curious why choose C and not C++ Oh wow to my gaming mind that looked similar to  pc processor lol, but im still amazed and hopefully this will be the technological boost needed to push india into the forefront of technological development",4393,0.94,1555897670.0

*This is just an announcement. The AMA thread will be posted by the guest at 2 PM tomorrow.*


",49," This is huge. Well done! Good one Mods! 
Please someone ask her what her plans for entire India would be like in education, as I may not be online around that time.  Very cool and epic Would there be a chance to ask our questions prior to the start? Time constraints here make it hard to be online at that time. okay that's nice. Do kejriwal next please noice! well done mods Great job mods. Here are two of my questions in case I don't make it online then:

1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?

2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Wow. Amazing.

RemindMe! 14 hours  My questions to Atishi:

1. AAP has done wonderful work in primary education. What is your vision for professional and higher education?
2. In view of the looming threat of AI taking over most lower level jobs in about a decade, what is your vision for education which will make students employable in the future? Why is the Marlena last name suddenly getting dropped everywhere? This is GRAND! This is so huge. Good work!!!  u/kash_if where is the AMA post? Woah. This is great!! Looking forward to it. [deleted] Will you become the Education Minister of India in a future coalition government?  To Atishi 


1. What changes does India need in higher education, professional courses?


2. What freedoms should parents provide their children to develop as a better person?


3. Does the super costly schools(where mostly the very rich study) teach something unique that is a challenge to bring to the government schools?


4. What do you do when you are not working for education or advising AAP?


5. What message do you want to give to the youth in their 25 to 35 years of age? Continue working, take courses? anything you want to say


6. What are your long term plans for education if you keep doing what you are doing for a decade or more?


7. Is the AAP government working on any promising long term solution for pollution? Are the kids motivated to take charge?

8. Have you been approached by any other state or center to do your work at a larger scale? We would love to have you India's HRD Minister. If AAP pushes your name as HRD minister - you might actually get support from other parties and wider constituents. Best of luck for Lok Sabha elections. Shit

Also, have you ever been to any open gyms yet or is it just a fake lie? I have seen best and worst of my life in 20 yrs of stay in Delhi. Its an interesting place tbh , but tons of egoist , assholes ,pseudo  elites , super bewkoof , dedh chaalaaks makes it difficult for a simpleton from a small city (me) have some some peace of mind . So , my question is ...Why can't Delhites simply accept what they are , what they have , what they can and what they can't at all ? Whatsupp with Dilli se hun BC attitude ? I remember you asked for advice on a date some time back. How'd that go Saar? What's your best buy from Sarojini?
What scares you the most?
What's your favorite ice cream flavor? Assume you have two things to eat, One Freshly made and one Stale from the morning..just re-heated.

1. Most people believe intraday is like gambling, what do you say?

2. And how much time did it take to become a master in trading? Is it your full time job?

3. Also do you have some insider information that us plebs can't even fathom? Finally! 

I'm a CA student and have maintained a decent portfolio. I have a few (many) questions for you. 😊😊

1. What reading material would you suggest to a young **investor** to get a grip of trading?
2. I once lost 10k in an intra day trade. Haven't dared to trade again. How to get out of the fear?
3. How to get a good grasp of trading in futures?
4. Do you use algo trading? If yes, how did you learn to code and what books have you read to be good at algo trading?
5. How do you maintain your cool when you incur a big loss on a bad day? 
6. Can you tell us more about your daily lifestyle? Your routine etc. Seems like you beat u/risingsteam 's allegation from the last year post that you were just a lucky orangutun.

> ""I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

  


> Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

  


> Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

  


> By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”

  


> By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips."" Kudos on crossing 1cr on trading. I have a couple of questions for you.

1. What got you into trading in the first place. Any insight into your background?

2. What was the learning curve involved.
How did you reach where you are right now? Can you break it up into the skills (and necessary sources) and other resources needed to start off? How did you start learning. How can begginers learn to do this. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Is this your full time job or you do it part time?
2. How many days of the year you work in one year?
3. How many hours you spend per day? How much capital do you need to start with to make investing your full time job ? So that one can live off the profits and doesn't need to do other jobs to earn a living. What’s your basic strategy - Momentum trading , special situations ? Also did you ever calculate your sharpe ratio. 

Congrats on hitting 1cr hope you make 10x out of it ! Congratulations. wow! do you recommend any book a beginner can get. 1. Do you hold stock positions for more than one day if the position is making loss on that day? 
2. Whats your average trade size? Like, how many RIL shares will you buy in one go before squaring it off?
3. which sectors are your favourite? I burned my hands trying to stay invested in auto stock Biggest loss amount? What are your most common trading instruments? Do you think mutual funds is a good investment strategy ? Between real estate and mutual funds which would you pick ? do you trade as an individual or have you set up an LLC or something?  Can you spill some secrets on how to win in intraday? I’ve made a few thousands trading but mostly I am holding long because I can’t win consistently in intraday. What strategy should I use? Also, which TA tool is the best? I personally use only BB, RSI and MACD. What would you recommend to a person who wants to get into it and maybe pursue trading as a side business while studying? How much tax have you paid on the CG? ever get stuck with an intraday short you could not cover by EOD? What's your age and when did you started intraday trading? I don't want you to dispense any misconceptions my way. I've enough of my own, thanks. [deleted] Can you give a short introduction on how to start trading and where to start, what books to read, sites you recommend and scams to avoid, for a noob like me. I don’t understand leverage in stock market did you use technical analysis?
if not, please describe your strategy. I dont have any spare money.

How can I get started with this? Intra day trader! I actually don’t believe in technicals, charts don’t work. That’s why most of the intra day traders don’t make it. But the people look at the candles and what not and still make money. May be it works but I just can’t bring myself to believe it does. Congrats to you though for making lots of money! Congrats I want to start trading too, what are the formal procedures(bank accounts etc) to get started and how to choose a broker.
Also suggest the simplest way to get started Few questions : 
a) What percentage of your trade are Intraday ? 
b) How long on an average are your non intraday trades ?
c) if there are 10 metrics you measure for making a buy/sell call what are those ? would love to know some of the statistics on your trades. especially win/loss ratio, number of trades. I am en engineer by profession and would like to explore the world of trading. I have absolutely 0 knowledge on the subject. I just read you recommending Rupee tales by Zerodha. Any Youtube channels instead? Thanks for the AMA. I have always looked down upon trading as everyone I know lost their money in the market (my dad, my mama etc). I am in a comfortable place in IT right now and I can take a bit of the risk with my money. Please know that I know absolutely nothing about trading.

I see you recommend zerodha varsity. But the question is, can one start with capital as small as 1 lakh? Just to test the waters? Would you recommend intraday trading for a guy with a regular 9 - 5 job? I feel there are two knowledge components: one is understanding the technical stuff like what is a short. 

The other part is following the industry - daily news and analysis which allows you to make informed decisions. What sources do you recommend for this?

What is your view on Zerodha smallcases? I don't have the time to trade intraday. Is it viable to make money through swing trading over a few days? Kind of a stupid question. Which brokerage firm do you use for trading? Who provides the best online platform for trading in India? WoW. Congrats Manu vai. Have you tried your hand at CryptoCurrency trading? Or at least ever held any Crypto? When should a person start investing and how much of his income should he invest and where to get decent profits and stable passive income. I am a beginner and am interested in concept of dividend funds, are they helpful in the long run? How you do you differentiate between a pull back and a reversal? Which technique do you rely on?
Technical, fundamental or quantitative? [deleted] 1. Do you stay alone? Or with your parents?
2. If you live with family, what do they think of your work? Do you have your setup in a room?
3. Do you sell naked OTM puts? So I am someone with high risk appetite and have a few lacs that I want to invest (or rather I want to experiment with). But I don't want to do intraday trading full time, so what goals should I set myself? Also, do you mainly invest on stocks or do you bet on macroeconomic aspects as well? For professionals who dont have time but still want to have a investment going in stocks ,what would be your best advice...?
Also how much return should i realistically be looking for.
I have few investments with bluechip and as per their advice ,have invested in few mutual funds.
Should i do anything differently.? If I can spare a decent amount of capital, what would you recommend as my starting reading material? 

In no hurry to make quick money 1) Which software you are using?
2) How many people you have hired?
3) How you keep check on greed and need of your investment?
4) what are the major complications in this business? I'm not 18 legally. But I started trading through my father this year. I turned 10K to 13.5K in March when I started, then bought ALBK. My father said I'm making too many trades. So I'm waiting till August to invest via my own account. I have a few questions, and anybody can answer them:

1. How do I invest 10K? There is no way I can increase my capital or whatever 10K is. I really want to trade and learn the craft.

2. Which online broker should I use?

3. How do I stay on top of the news? Wanted to understand about your technique. These signals that you talk about, they automatically which means you are using an API? Which brokers provide a good set. Also, any of them provide intraday volumes as well along with price? Investing is mostly going against the tide (buy stocks with bearish sentiments) whereas trading is going with the tide (follow market sentiments).  
How much do you agree with the above statement? So you are telling us all you had more than 200% annualised returns thats more than 2 bps per trade on average assuming you made fewer than 10,000 trades(Thats is an already an absurdly large number of trades)!!! Wow!!!

That is so unbelievable I don't even believe you :/

But hey man fair play to you if its true. I think you would be among the most successful trader of all time. Do you believe in technical analysis? Especially in intraday trading. Hi Manu, I am regular 24 year old with a job that doesn't allow me to day trade. However, i'd still like to get started with investing: trading, funds and other financial instruments to supplement my income. Where can I start? Are there any courses you would suggest?

I do not mind paying for training on how to invest. I only ask that it fits into my lifestyle, and doesn't require me to invest multiple hours at end. Hey man, late to the party. NRI swing trader here and what you're doing is beyond my ultimate dream so I have a few questions for you.

1. Did you test your strategies on international markets (like on demo accounts). I'm curious if it's work on NASDAQ and NYSE

2. Do you place both long and short positions or just long?

3. It's a very bullish market. If I had invested in almost any tech stock a year ago, I'd have doubled my money. What makes your strategy stand out?

5. Did your position size get bigger as your account grew or did you always trade with same size.

4. Any tips to make 2% a week? just couple days ago was thinking about you wondering where are you right now. and bamm here you are. Would you say that to trade successfully it needs to be a full-time job? Meaning someone occupied 10 hours every day in another job can't possibly spare the time to learn the right information. This is some WSB level shit. You are quoting 30% returns as predictable in your comments. It’s all fun and games when we are in a 10 year bull market but I feel bad for the idiots who’re going try this and lose everything!

Yeah I made a killing betting on tech stocks over the past two years but I’m not stupid enough to claim my intelligence had anything to do with it. I'm not from a business/engineering background. Got no idea about trading but know that starting early is better. I'm already in my early 20s. What do I do? How do I start investing with minimal income? What will be your advice to someone who doesn't know anything about trading but wants to make money of it. How do I start? Would you do an AMA after you lose your money too? Hey congrats question do you keep tight Stop-loss for your strategy means in terms of profit in percent how much is your stop-loss for each trade? Have you ever thought increasing capital impacts return of your strategy due to slippage? Hello friend. I am learning for investing into stock I am learning by watching youtube videos. Can you guide what would be a better way to learn more into investing stocks? Background: I used to work for a large hedge fund in a technology role. The hedge fund employed quantitative strategies in addition to a large array of research analysts.

I have been trading on my own for more than a year. I have had some great profits, and great losses.

I wrote this for all those who think they can make quick money in the market by choosing a security and choosing a time and direction. Listen up.

You are an uninformed trader. You do not have any special information about the future which is not also available to the professionals.

All ""easy"" informed trading is done almost immediately by computers. An example is: stock A is at $10. There is new information which is clearly bullish. Within a second, the stock will be at $12. The new price reflects the new information. You cannot beat the computers at informed trading.

New ""complex"" information about an asset has to be analysed and accepted by others for it to be trade-worthy. You can not hope to be a better analyst than professionals who have training, tools and access to insiders. That doesn't mean all analysts are right or in agreement, but only that their opinion is more informed than yours. Again, you cannot hope to profit using analysis of ""complex"" information if the market doesn't agree with you. Reading a Seeking Alpha article (and the comments) is not analysis.

After the information is priced in, any further price movement is driven by supply-demand and not by new information. You cannot guess at supply-demand. It happens in real time and big traders fiercely protect the content of their future orders. I laugh at people who buy $TWTR AFTER getting the information that Jack Dorsey also bought some last week. There may be a sentiment rally if others start buying, there may not be. You really don't know.

Charting is useful only in hindsight. Prior price/volume action has no bearing on future price/volume action. You say pivot points? Let us say SPY is reaching 237.00 from above. Everybody says it is an important ""support"". What does that mean? Will it break that support or not? If it breaks, will it go much lower, or bounce back up to reclaim the support? Again, you don't know. Today SPY broke and bounced off that support 3 or 4 times before definitively breaking down. Which break-down is definitive? It is only clear in hindsight.

Now, all the above should make it clear that, in essence, you are an uninformed trader, that is, you are trading blind. That means, charitably speaking, that your chances of the asset moving in a favorable direction are 50-50.

But still you will lose. There are two reasons for this. One relates to the way trades happen, and other is about human psychology.

(a) If you place a limit buy or limit sell, your order will only execute while the ticker is moving unfavorably to you. 
  That is, if the stock is moving down from your limit buy price, your buy order will execute. And if it is moving up beyond your limit sell price, your sell order will execute. In each case (unless you are closing a trade), you are immediately at a loss as the price continues its movement.

( If the price is not moving much, you are immediately at a loss due to the bid/ask spread.  And you likely bought because you thought it was a bargain and the recent past showed a downward price movement and you were bullish on it.  More often than not, price movement continues in the same direction.  Reversals are rare and hard to time.)

This means, that

(b) You immediately are in pain. You see a loss and will likely see it widening as the price movement continues.

Now you have many options:

i) You can exit the trade at a loss. Bummer.

ii) You can execute another trade in the same direction to average your price. This again suffers from the same problem. The price is moving away from you while all your orders execute. Your new trade is as uninformed as the last one.

iii) You can hold the bag, ""hoping"" for a reversal.

Both in (ii) and (iii), you are now holding the bag.

Let us talk about that.

Usually, the price will continue to move while you see the red becoming redder. You regret the trade. You are stressed. You have averaged it 3, maybe 4 times already. You want to at least exit at break-even.

Therefore, as soon as the price reverses and it shows you a modest profit, you will itch to book the profit and relax. Hence, you will make the all-too-common (but understandable) trader mistake of holding your losers and quitting your winners. After the trade shows some green, because you have experienced the red, you will be afraid that it will again go red. You will be wanting to not go through that pain again.

Therefore you will usually see losers in your portfolio with a loss % of 20 or even 50, but you will never see that kind of profit %. Ever. You would have booked the profit at 2% or 5%.

So what's the consequence? Even assuming each trade has a 50-50 chance of going your way, your losses will always be bigger than your winners.

Eventually, you will curse trading and seek gainful employment.

Hope it was helpful.

 What about if you use stop limits with market orders and trade into ""momentum""? This can work, some of the time.  How do you determine that the momentum is going to continue and not reverse soon after?  But the main problem is the stops.  If you have a tight stop, volatility will take you out.  If you have a wide stop, your loss will be wide too.  Figuring out a proper stop based on ""pivot points"" and past realized volatility is not that straightforward, but it can work if enough other people believe in your pivot point too.

I still trade, but am a more humble trader after the experiences.  It is possible to develop an edge, but it takes specialized skills and hard work.

TL;DR: If you don't have a well-defined edge, you cannot hope to day trade for profit in the long term. Saar job milegi? When will you get a real job? [deleted]",205,0.94,1557583627.0

AMA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgsh11/im_a_16lpm_elite_mba_who_cant_find_a_job_ama/,AMA,I graduated from one of the best b-schools of India. I did fairly well (top 20% of my batch) and got a good placement. But the company went bankrupt after 2 years. I've been looking for a new job for the last 3 months but haven't been able to find anything.,239," A lot of times companies just don't process your resume after looking at your previous salary. This has been very apparent in software professionals who switched to a software job in a financial institution (jpmc, Nomura etc) and then left it. Is 1.6 lakh a decent salary for an elite MBA grad? Do you think number of jobs have decreased in the market now as compared to say 3 years ago? Hah 3 months is rich, took.me 6 to even get a job..... 

Hold tight man , it will come. Did you take education loan, if yes then how much, if no then what was your total kharcha for the MBA? As someone who is doing a job after BBA and is stuck between doing Papa ka business or making a career by myself. Is MBA worth the 20-30L of investment? I am 33 year old planning to do 1 year MBA from IIM A/B/C/L or XLRI. I am typical Indian IT male (IIM) with average academics. 

Reason for MBA: I am working in IT service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing. But now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into Management. So why not get MBA Degree and jump state career as manager in IT.

Should I do MBA ? 

Keep looking buddy you will find the Job soon. Is it worth doing an MBA, if even without it you're earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? Vaguely related, but as a non Indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an MBA at such a young age in India. In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s. And isn't that the original purpose of an MBA anyway, to do it only after having a decent amount of experience (but I might be misguided here)? It's been tough, but while searching for new openings I hope you're also enjoying this free period while it lasts ( hope it doesn't last too much though).  
   
Btw apart from the money you made, you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? What job role were you doing? Which location are you looking for? MBA in what?
I may be able to refer you if something matches. will you work in a company that would pay 20%-30% less than your previous pay? Among HR, marketing and finance if you had to pick one which would you select based on the demand? Was the company a startup? Campus placement? Can relate to this situation. Hope you land a good job!   
Incase you are looking for some leads, do DM. We are hiring in my team. Need good finance knowledge. How/Why did your company go bankrupt? At what age did you get your job at 1.4 lakhs pm ? What was your CAT %ile/GMAT? (Optional :P)

Do you regret taking a niche job instead of consulting/IB etc. ?

Does your academic history before MBA matter much after MBA? Why did it fail? And what do you think the founders/management could have done differently to save it? What would have you done? 

Also, is the product still 'out there'? I feel joy in reviving past/broken/failed products, if only money was a constraint. alumni help nahi karta ? [deleted] Bhai, when i read your story, I had to check whether I had posted it myself. Only difference is I was fired for factors within and without my control. I had taken this unemployment thing a bit lightly - my company gave me three months time to find another job. The first month went with a flurry of interview from good companies - flunked them all since I was under prepared and tensed.
The second month, I took a step back, started reading and playing PUBG. I am now in the third month and have recently started applying. You situation seems to have added a sense of urgency now and thank you for that. I am currently not too worked up since I have the finances to pay off the loan and live unemployed for quite a few months at home.

However the prospect of continued unemployment is now looking a bit worrisome. I have started working on constructive habits such as waking up at 6:00 AM, meditating, exercising - key habits that have let me down in the past and hopefully will help me in the future. I am more concerned how my parents will react  - I haven't told them yet. 

Any help in this regard will very helpful. It's unclear if you ""can't find a job"" because of being picky about offers or because you haven't gotten an offer.   
Either way, your asset is the network, not the degree. Check your college email ID for job leads. Post on your alumni telegram and whatsapp groups, preferably also the city group and not only the batch group. And spend less time on reddit till this is over.  


Source: Am a 1.6lpm ""elite"" MBA who can find a job any week of the month 1.6lpm on paper or in hand? 

Any previous experience prior to MBA? 
MBA in what? 

PM me your resume, will refer in my company if I like it. Salary shouldn't be a problem if you are good. First of all sorry for your situation. Have you tried working in start ups for stocks rather than huge salary? The reason I am asking this is because, I am from a similar B school and initially I worked in a small start up for gaining experience. With just a 5 minute video, I want you to help me understand with real examples about what you studied in MBA and what type of things you do on job.

Because a lot of people say ""Bro become a software developer they earn 2.3lpm"" but very few people talk about the annoying and nerdy codes they write for hours. What about job referrals through buddies? Beyond a point depending on recruiters doesnt make sense... especially if you are in 1.6lpa bracket. Dear OP,
Please tell me which area of business you want to work in - Ops, Analytics, HR, Finance or Strategy. If you wish it so, I can help you with a referral at my current org, provided there are matching opportunities and you are also similarly inclined.
Thanks. Get to Bangalore, make a list of 50 companies and walk into their offices with a flower bouquet and 2 senior contact names. Ask to meet them and ask for a job.

&#x200B;

Two companies per day and in four weeks, you will have atleast a dozen leads. Is your salary expectation a factor? Are you Lord of the rings fan? What did you major in before your MBA? I hope you won't mind answering 

I am doing btech rn in a relatively new field (biotechnology) I have absolutely no interest in research and would like to get into a corporate job.
How exactly should I plan my career?
I am planning on finishing my degree, get a job, leave it after a year or two and get an MBA and get back to the corporate world.

Also, have you tried getting a job abroad? Hey Bro! There are lots of referral groups on WhatsApp and other social media for Top MBA college students. You can try subscribing to those. A lot of my friends having your mentioned salary switched jobs using these groups. Okay. Prepared for the down-votes so here goes. Sorry bout your situation, but this is only the start of an epidemic. Our gen needs to wake up from this MBA gold rush. Working as an AI programmer, I can bet my balls this is a trend that will grow exponentially in the coming years.

Management is a dead industry. Why? Cause A.I! Management is part of occupations that you can  term 'pseudo-expertise'. When a $12/month EC2 cluster can be trained to make the same decisions as you why would I expend 40L/year? That's just reality and the sooner we get with it the better.

How many fingers am i holding up? ✌ How is the result? Any irritation in eye? Did anyone care about who you were before you put on the mask? [deleted]  glasses gone Swag mode on 😁 What did the doctor say about the long term effects ? I'm too thinking of doing LASIK but I've heard in most cases eye sight gets dull again after a few years. Thanks for posting, this has been very informative for someone planning on getting lasik. lasik se tum gori ho gayi ho..

&#x200B;

/s [deleted] I got this procedure done 3 years ago. AMA Can cylindrical correction be fixed via Lasik? How does it feel being a girl on r/india ?  How many DMs you have got till now? Did your office cover it? Or personal expense? How much vision did you get back. ?

I got 90% back.

&#x200B; Has this boosted your confidence? And do people act differently around you since you no longer wear glasses?  How many years did you wear glasses for? It sounds weird but I've worn glasses for half my life and I feel like it'll be weird to get used to not having them (though I'd love to not be dependent on them all the time) Do you think not having glasses now has changed your personality in some ways? I got mine done in 2013, I wonder how much has changed since then. I have the same power. Can you give me your specs? lol my brother got a lasik recently, now he is the hot one. So you got your surgery done and doctors advised to avoid screen exposure and here you are hosting AMA. Good god, lady, go and sleep. LASIK gang hi5. Got it done 3yrs back. Was -6.

Also, I got cooler shades after the procedure. Huh!  Exact procedure name? 

Hospital?

Total cost?

Totally corrected or you still need glasses? [deleted] What is the cost of the treatment?  Why do you look more excited before surgery than after it though? Btw was your vision stable for a few years? How long did the full procedure take? Is LASIK risk free?  I get anxiety thinking I might lose my sight. Did insurance cover your surgery? How have you adjusted to your non glasses look? Did you asked your doctor about PRK? If so did he recommended it? Damn. I feel like a retard. People are asking question while I'm scratching my head because I didn't understand the post itself Did you have astigmatism? I’d like to correct my vision, but apparently I’m not a good candidate because of astigmatism.   Getting lasik done was one of the best decision of my life. it's been five years now. Having thick specs throughout school added to my introversion and social anxiety and kind of made me waste a lot of years under insecurities. after lasik, being active was easier, not needing to pick up glasses first thing in morning was a big big freedom. somehow it helped me become a better person. I won't say I'm completely free of social anxiety but with better confidence its easier to handle life.  

Today I and everyone have forgotten that I ever wore glasses. I don't have any photo from my school life.  but every once in while I still think about the freedom lasik got me and I feel grateful for being able to see clearly.

Enjoy the freedom and take care of your eyes.  Just when I thought of getting LASIK done, this AMA comes up. Good thing to be honest. I'm trying to get  Contoura Vision Eye Surgery which also is a type of LASIK. My question is how many days did the doctor advice you to not look directly at the sun or any bright objects? I mean how many days after you can return to your normal life style, job, using computer etc.? Opti-Lasik made you cool ..will hit on right girl for sure I am 17 with -7.2 vision. Reading this thread is a huge relief. Thank you. It's cool that the doctors changed ur dress and pumped some protein in u for no extra cost AMA? 

PM me your phone number.  Don’t mean to be rude but what’s the point of this? Why is their a advertisement in that washroom?
Is that your office or what?  Is their any risk? 

On the side note, how did you manage to be so skinny?  How long has your prescription been stable? I think I have similar power and was looking at Lasik, did they inform you of the risks? If the surgery goes wrong, do you just go blind? Your top matches you bag/jacket or whatever it is you’re holding or it’s just a dirty mirror? :P Hey! my girlfriend is planning to get it done, I am a little bit concerned about it. Is there anything she must know about the procedure, apart from the usual that you can't be out for a month?  Is there a minimum power for which the surgery takes place? How old are you?what's minimum age requirement? Hi, how much time does it require to recover
I am planning for one, but will have work commitments  Which phone is that?  Can you also tell us what was your power last year and a year before last year? 

I wanted to get LASIK done to my eyes this year, my power was constant for last 2-3 years and just this year it decreased to -4.5 from -5. Doctor said to wait for one more year.  Total cost and recovery time? So, for how long you will be away from work??  I can't tell the difference in your eyes, though I do notice that you're wearing completely different clothing, different eye piece, changed hair style, are now wearing a backpack. What am I missing ? Is there any age limit/barrier to get this done? is it worth it?  I envy people who can get LASIK done. I’ve been waiting for a decade till I would turn 18 and when I did I was told that there’s risk that my retina might get detached again. Well I guess I’ll have to stick to contacts and specs for the rest of my life.  why Lasik why not SMILE eye surgery? I see most of your comments were 2 hours ago, so you'll probably not reply. Anyway. 

How do you avoid eye strain post surgery, seeing as screens are everywhere and I'm assuming you didn't take a vacation or a 'tech cleanse'(?)...?

Also, what's the best place to get some parathas in Bangalore.? what was the cost of opreation?? You became a Badass!
 Nice. Do you know if someone with higher order aberrations in their vision can get corrective surgery? Mine is -3 cyl left eye.. I was advised not to go for LASIK as my cyl power is high.. I am optimistic now looking at you . Someday! How much did it cost ? u/_hein_ ok i have some similar doubts, i also reside in Bangalore, do you have astigmatism on your left eye?, if so, is it in just one eye? 

i can see vertical double vision with just one eye closed on my right, meaning even if i close my left eye, it doesnt matter i can still see double, TEXT and right below it a shadow TEXT, i wanted to know if you also have the same problem and if did LASIK solve it, because i can't read properly as night arrives and can't read text on dark backgrounds, can't drive at nights as i can see everything twice from lights on street to vehicles that it gets annoying to drive at all at night.  So what are we suppose to do, look into her eyes? was the anesthesia  local or generalised? [deleted] Only one question. Why the AMA?  kiran rao? That neck though. Nobody fucking cares, go back to FB . 

Also, where's the proof, all I see is a selfie attagirl. you look big on the right(!)

I too had a LASIK 3 years back. Do follow 30-30-30 rule & keep your eyes moist!

""Why are there so many new accounts in this thread?
"" Why do Indians on reddit never learn about how to do an AMA? Failure after failure after failure It's really quite amusing how he mentions that he is an IIT Alumni and CEO... Look man, we are all supportive of new startups but you gotta learn humbleness and how to sell an idea.

 Putting your background info on display instead of features and USP of product clearly shows that you lack confidence in your own product. Grade A chutiya.

Guess cheating in exams (and life)is a life long trait.

Was this AMA enough, guy? LOL! How do you if someone is from IIT? They tell you in the first sentence lol. Wow... it is very interesting to see people commenting on my AMA in an entirely separate group. I am that CEO from the AMA.  


Of the many things said here, people have criticized the ""waving of IIT tag"". There were two reasons for that:  
1. People don't trust that we can build good products out of India and they necessarily have to come from US / China / other countries. We hope to change that by bringing a product from India to the world.  
2. This product was designed in labs of IIT Bombay. This is our way of giving the due credit to the institute.

&#x200B;

Could we have worded it better? Absolutely. What was good however was that people asked some very relevant questions about drones globally, drones in India and industry in general and I really enjoyed answering them.  


I appreciate this thread and the AMA, especially because:  
1. It showed us how passionate people are on Reddit  
2. Good learning on what mistakes to avoid on the platform. failing how ? anyone here into drones? can you recommend me one? Just went through the thread. Too much technical jargon. Anybody care to explain the cringe? Thanks! ",61,0.82,1536376717.0

Congratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving Indian audiences something new. But having read the book I think the treatment could have been better and I would like to get your opinion on this. 

I feel a lack of connect with the characters, of course the major characters of Gaitonde and Sartaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about Jojo, Mathur, Kanta bai and of course Parulkar sahab excellent actors all btw. I guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track. Taking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate.
